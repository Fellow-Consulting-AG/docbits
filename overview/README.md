**What is API Integration?**

API Integration is the process of connecting two or more applications via APIs to enable them to communicate with each other. This allows the applications to perform a common function or exchange information, ensuring data integrity.

**How to Get Your API Key**

To get started with API Integration in DocBits, you will need your API Key. You can find your API Key in the Integration menu item in the settings. Simply copy and paste your API Key into your application to start integrating with DocBits.

**API Calls and Examples**

**API Calls for Document Upload and Status Check**

API integration provides functions and services that connect applications and processes. In this guide, we will show you how to make API calls through api.polydocs.io for document upload and status check.

**Authentication**

To make API calls, authentication is the first step. Follow the steps below to authenticate:

1. Open [api.docbits.com](https://api.docbits.com/).
2. Click on Authorize in the upper right corner.
3. Enter your [API Key](https://docs.fellowpro.com/docbits/settings/integration/api-integration/) and confirm by clicking Authorize.

**Upload Document**

To upload a document, follow the steps below:

* After authentication, scroll down to the POST /document/process endpoint.
* Open the tab and click on Try it out in the upper right corner.
* Enter the following value in the source field: email:{Pattern name}.
* Select the file you want to upload and click Execute.

Your document will be uploaded to your dashboard with the rules you set in DocBits.

Document Status Check

To check the status of a document, follow the steps below:

* After authentication, scroll down to the GET /document/status endpoint.
* Open the tab and click on Try it out in the upper right corner.
* Enter the document ID in the doc-id field. You can find the document ID when you open the document on the dashboard. This is the last part of the URL when the document is open.

You will receive the following response

If the status is “Ready For Validation,” it means that the user can check the document.

**Uploading a Document with Metadata**

To upload a document with metadata, follow the steps below:

* After authentication, scroll down to one of these endpoints: /document/process\_documents, /document/process, or /document/process\_base64.
* Open the tab and click on Try it out in the upper right corner.
* Enter the metadata in the metadata field. The metadata needs to be in a valid JSON format. An example of a metadata entry would be: {"custom-key": "the custom value", "custom\_doc\_id": "8a5cf33b-c923-4879-96ca-94d69965d508"}.
* Select a file to upload.
* Click Execute.
* Wait for the response. If the metadata field is not a valid JSON, an error message will appear. If “success”: true, then your document will be uploaded to your dashboard with the rules you set in DocBits.

#### **Document Expiry** <a href="#id-33bxgoqd3vgw" id="id-33bxgoqd3vgw"></a>

If you would like to keep your DocBits Dashboard tidy and up to date, consider the document expiry function.

For each field you can check the boxes if they are:

* **REQUIRED**: Here you can define if the field must contain a value to continue.
* **READ ONLY**: Here you can define if a field can only be displayed but not edited.
* **HIDDEN**: Here you can define whether a field should be hidden or displayed in the extraction view.
* **FORCE VALIDATION**: Here you can define whether a field must always be validated manually, even if it has been read 100% by DocBits.
* **OCR** and **MATCH SCORE**: Setting as described below, per field.
* **FORMULA**: Creation of a formula per field.

If all settings are made and should be saved, please confirm this with the SAVE SETTINGS button at the bottom of the page, otherwise the settings will not be applied.

**Recognition Settings**



**OCR**

Here you can set the sensitivity of the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) function for all fields at once. This value determines the sensitivity with which a field is marked in red if it could not be extracted with 100% certainty (OCR related!).

**Match Score**

Here you can set the sensitivity of the MATCH SCORE function for all fields at once. This value determines when a field is marked in red if DocBits has not extracted the field with 100% probability. In this case the field needs to be validated manually.

The button RESTORE DEFAULTS will set back both values to “50”.

**Profile**

Here you can define the profile that shall be used. Either Default or ZUGFeRD.\
In profile ZUGFeRD there are predefined fields that are mandatory for this type of invoice.\

Understanding the Document Exporting Process in DocBits

When you are ready to export a document, select the export option at the bottom of the validation screen.

If the feature is enabled, the document’s status will change to “Pending Approval”.

The document is now in queue for approval.

Assign the approver using the “assign” button on the Dashboard. You can also manage email notifications for the approver(s) through Settings → Email Notification.

Use the Approval Before Export feature to streamline your document management process in DocBits, making your workflows more efficient.

**Doc Script**

If you want to use scripts that, for example, **convert currency characters or written-out currency names into ISO codes**, activate this first in the Settings → Modules → Doc Script.

After that, go to the desired document type. Once here, select the Scripts option.

You will be taken to the Scripts Menu. Once here, click on +NEW.

From here you have the choice of a Label, the document type, when the script for the document type should be triggered and also a specific sub document type if necessary. After adding the script in the provided area, click on SAVE.

For example:

currency\_map = {

"€": "EUR",

"EURO": "EUR",

"$": "USD",

"£": "GBP"

}

currency\_value = get\_field\_value(fields\_dict, "currency", None)

if currency\_value:

currency\_value = currency\_value.upper()

if currency\_value in currency\_map:

currency\_value = currency\_map\[currency\_value]

set\_field\_value(fields\_dict, "currency", currency\_value)



In the next step, upload a document with one of the following criteria: “€”, “EURO”, “$” or “£”.

When the document is ready for validation, open this and click in the Currency validation field. You will be prompted to select the appropriate area on the image. Now do this with the € sign.

You will then immediately see that € is converted to EUR by the script. The same is done by the script when you mark EURO on the invoice.

**Doc Scan**

**Download Scanner Software**

Click Scan Document on the DocBits Dashboard

As your scanner is not installed yet, you’ll get the following message

Depending on which operating system you use, press the appropriate button to download.

Open the installation file and you will see the following

Click on \`Continue\`, accept the Software License Agreement with \`Agree\` and continue to install the software.

Installing this software requires 33,6 MB of space. You can change the install location before clicking \`Install\` in the next step. As soon as the following screen is displayed you’re almost done.

Open web browser to test if the app works by entering: https://local.polydocs.io:12500/

If you see this message on the screen, you must first configure some settings in your FritzBox network settings if you are using one.

When you see this screen you are ready to click on DocBits.

You will be redirected to the DocBits login page where you can enter your credentials to access your dashboard.

All you have to do now is activate Doc Scan in the settings under Modules.

**FritzBox network settings**

If you get the following error after installing and calling up the url https://local.polydocs.io:12500/, the reasons are:

* DNS resolution of private IP addresses not possible.
* DNS resolution for domain names that refer to private IP addresses in the FRITZ!Box home network is not possible via the FRITZ!Box. This means that server services in the FRITZ!Box home network cannot be accessed via the domain name.

You may see one of the following error messages:

* “DNS timed out”
* “DNS request timed out”

For security reasons, the FRITZ!Box suppresses DNS responses that refer to IP addresses in your own home network. This is a security feature of the FRITZ!Box to protect against so-called DNS rebinding attacks.

If you use a FritzBox, you must first make the following settings in the FritzBox menu:

* In the FRITZ!Box user interface, click on \`Heimnetz\`.
* \`Heimnetz\` Click in the menu \`Netzwerk\`.
* Click on the tab \`Netzwerkeinstellungen\`.

In the Hostname exceptions \`DNS-Rebind-Schutz section\`, enter local.polydocs.io for which DNS rebind protection should not apply. Confirm with \`Übernehmen\`

Uninstall Doc2Scan Service Manager

**IDM ACL Updater**

**Feature Description**

This is a feature which, every 6 hours, uses the ION-API file to connect to your Infor-IDM and check through the newest/latest documents of the IDM-document-type(s) the DocBits team has configured at your request, and if the document type has an incorrect ACL-Setting (for example public), it will then be changed to the ACL-Setting you want (for example private). The image below illustrates the configuration of the API performing this feature

The API is called “DocBits-Error” and is situated at the end in the above dataflow. The endpoint mapped to the API (DocBits\_Import) is the endpoint that carries out the functions discussed earlier.
