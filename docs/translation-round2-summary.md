## Conclusion

Translation Round 2 successfully completed with 100% success rate, translating 35 critical pages covering financial processing rules, barcode extraction, and workflow management to all 6 languages. Combined with Round 1, we have achieved 55.1% coverage (up from 44.2%), with 79 pages translated across 6 languages for a total of 474 translation instances.

The focus on Rule Manager and workflow pages provides users with essential guidance for configuring complex financial document processing scenarios, improving the overall user experience for non-English speaking customers.
