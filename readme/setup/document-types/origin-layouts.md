## **Understanding Origin-Based Customization**

* Currency and Format Standardization: Regardless of the original document’s currency or format, DocBits converts these elements into a standardized ISO format on the server, in line with the user’s browser settings.
* Geographical Layout Customization: The system allows customization of document layouts based on their geographical origin. This means you can define specific fields and formats for documents from different countries.

## **Example: U.S. vs. Germany Layouts**

* U.S. Layout: For a U.S. invoice, you might include fields for city tax, aligning with the common tax structure in the U.S.
* Germany Layout: In contrast, a German invoice layout may omit the city tax field, as it’s not a standard charge in Germany.

## **Using the Layout Builder**

* Select Origin Layout: In the Layout Builder, choose the base layout corresponding to the document’s origin.
* Customize Fields: Adapt the layout by adding or removing fields. For instance, include ‘City Tax’ for a U.S. layout.
* Apply and Test: Once customized, apply the layout to your documents and test to ensure accuracy.

## **Tips for Effective Customization**

* Understand Regional Differences: Familiarize yourself with the tax and format nuances of different regions.
* Consistent Updates: Regularly update your layouts to reflect any changes in regional regulations.
* User Feedback: Utilize feedback from users in different regions to refine layouts further.
