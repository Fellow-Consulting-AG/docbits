# Training Line Fields/Table Training

## Training Mode vs Correction Mode

When using our table extraction tool, you can choose between training mode and correction mode. Here’s what you need to know about each mode:

### Training Mode

In training mode, mapped columns are read-only, and you cannot manually change the text. Additionally, the delete row button is not visible.

### Correction Mode

In correction mode, you can delete and add rows, and you can manually change the text of mapped columns.
