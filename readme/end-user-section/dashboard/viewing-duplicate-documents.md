The user has two options for detecting duplicate invoices:

1. **Duplicate Document Detection** – This option checks for duplicate documents uploaded in DocBits
2.  **Duplicate Invoice Detection** – This option requires _Supplier Invoices_ to be synced from Infor to DocBits for duplicate detection

    **NOTE**: Using the **Duplicate Invoice Detection** feature will result in an additional credit charge.

Once the setting is turned on the user can select the criteria for duplicate detection

## Duplicate Invoices on Dashboard

Once Duplicate Detection is enabled in the settings, the dashboard will display an icon for any invoices identified as duplicates based on the specified criteria. Clicking this icon will open the duplicate records in a split-screen view for easy comparison

When the user opens the document a warning bar is shown for the duplicate invoices as shown in the screenshot
