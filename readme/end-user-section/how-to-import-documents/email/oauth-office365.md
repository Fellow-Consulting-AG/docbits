**Use Folder**

If you are using a folder other than your inbox, enter the folder name after enabling the slider.

**Use Shared Mailbox**

If you want the email import to access an inbox or a folder of a shared mailbox, input the email address here after enabling the slider.

**Move imported emails to trash**

If you want to import all emails, not just the unread ones, and have them moved to trash then activate this. If not, it will only check for unread emails, import the documents, set the email to read and leave it in its current place.
