# Mandatory PDP/PPF Channels – PEPPOL as Transport Only for France’s 2026 E-Invoicing

## PDP or PPF Required for Domestic B2B E-Invoices

Under France’s 2026 e-invoicing mandate, companies cannot rely solely on the PEPPOL network to exchange domestic B2B invoices. The law requires that all invoices between French VAT-registered businesses be routed through either a certified private platform (PDP) or the state’s public invoicing portal (PPF) to satisfy legal [requirements](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/technical/tax-alerts/france-revises-schedule-for-adopting-e-invoicing-reform) ￼. In other words, businesses will no longer send invoices directly to customers – they must transmit them via an approved e-invoicing platform (a PDP) or via the government [portal](https://www.avalara.com/blog/en/europe/2022/09/france-publishes-updated-specifications-for-e-invoicing-and-e-reporting.html) ￼. This ensures the tax authority receives the required data in real-time. Simply exchanging invoices over PEPPOL without involving an accredited PDP/PPF would not meet the mandated reporting and transmission obligations.

## PEPPOL Used Only as an Interoperability Layer

France is adopting PEPPOL as part of its infrastructure, but only as a transport layer within the PDP framework, not as an independent compliance route.  The French tax authority (DGFiP) is becoming the Peppol Authority to standardize how PDPs [interconnect](https://www.avalara.com/blog/en/europe/2025/01/e-invoicing-reform-france.html) . All certified PDPs are required to interconnect via the PEPPOL network for exchanging [invoices](https://nymus.be/fr/facturation-electronique-en-france/) .  This means PEPPOL will facilitate interoperability between authorized platforms – not replace the need for those platforms.  In practice, a company may use PEPPOL only by working through a PDP (or the PPF acting in its limited role) that uses PEPPOL to send or receive invoices. This has been confirmed in official guidance: the public portal is focusing on data collection, while invoice distribution will happen exclusively through PDPs, with those PDPs leveraging networks like [PEPPOL](https://edicomgroup.com/blog/status-of-b2b-electronic-invoicing-in-france) for [exchange](https://nymus.be/fr/facturation-electronique-en-france/) .

Source: Article 91 of France’s 2024 Finance Law (summarized by EY) mandates e-invoices be sent via a certified PDP or the state portal .  The French tax authority’s updates further clarify that after 2024 reforms, businesses must use a registered PDP for B2B e-invoicing (the PPF will no longer serve as a free exchange platform) .  PEPPOL is being implemented to connect these PDPs, not as an alternate channel outside the system . This confirms that using the PEPPOL network alone is insufficient – compliance in France’s 2026 e-invoicing regime requires integration with the PPF or a certified PDP, with PEPPOL serving only as the underlying delivery network among those platforms.
