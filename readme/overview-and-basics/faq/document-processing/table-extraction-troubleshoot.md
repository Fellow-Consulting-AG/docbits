# Table Extraction Troubleshoot

## **Step 1: Open OCR View for Bad Extraction Results**

If the table extraction training results are not good:

1. Open the **OCR View** by clicking on the magnifying glass icon with **OCR** written on it.
2. Review the extraction results and see if the OCR process can improve the data capture.
3. If the results still look bad, try a different document to verify if the issue is document-specific.
4. If the issue is document-specific, use another document for extraction.
   * If the issue persists, follow the next steps.

## **Step 2: Check for E-Text Availability**

1. Check if the document has **e-text** available.
   * You can verify this using a tool like **Adobe Acrobat**.
   * If the document contains e-text, follow **Step 3.**
   * If the document does not contain e-text, follow **Step 4.**

## **Step 3: Turn On E-Text Extraction**

If the document contains e-text, you have two options:

1. **Turn on e-text extraction for just this supplier**:
   * Go back to the **Documents Field Validation**.
   * Click the square with the three dots in the left-side toolbar.
   * Here, activate the **Use E-text if available** option to turn it on for just this supplier.
2. **Turn on e-text extraction for all suppliers**:
   * Go to **Settings** > **Document Processing** > **OCR Settings**.
   * In this section, you will find the **Use E-text if available** option and can turn it on for all suppliers.
3. After enabling e-text extraction, retry the **table extraction training**.
   * If the results improve, the issue is resolved.
   * If the results are still not good, proceed to **Step 4**.

## **Step 4: No E-Text Available - Change AI OCR Version**

If the document does not have e-text available:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Document Processing** > **OCR Settings**.
2. Change the **AI OCR Version** to a different version.
3. Go back to the **Table Extraction Training** and try again.
4. If the result is better:
   * Check other documents from different suppliers to ensure the extraction results for those suppliers are not impacted by this change.
   * **Be cautious, as this change can affect other suppliers' extraction results.**
   * This change can impact other suppliers, so make sure to verify the results thoroughly to ensure it does not negatively affect other suppliersâ€™ document extractions.
5. If the result did not improve after changing the AI OCR version, please **contact us** for further assistance.
