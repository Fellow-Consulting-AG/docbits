# Task Management

In the "Task Management" setting under "Log Settings" section, you will be given an overview of all celery tasks, their Intervals,  when the task was ran for the last time and when it will be run again. In addition, you will also have the option to run a task again. If you are in search of a specific task, you can use the search bar for it.&#x20;
