### [Case 1, 2, 3: Quantity and Unit Price Within Tolerance](transactionconfig-pro-template/case-1-2-3-quantity-and-unit-price-within-tolerance.md)

**Scenario:** Both the quantity and unit price on the invoice are within an acceptable tolerance range compared to the purchase order.

• **Action:** The system accepts the invoice values and calculates the total amount based on the provided quantity and unit price.

### [Case 4, 5: Quantity Within Tolerance, Unit Price Outside Tolerance (Approved)](transactionconfig-pro-template/case-4-5-quantity-within-tolerance-unit-price-outside-tolerance-approved.md)

**Scenario:** The quantity on the invoice is within tolerance, but the unit price is outside tolerance, and this variance has been approved.

• **Action:** The system adjusts the unit price to match the purchase order and applies any necessary line charges to account for the difference.

### Case 6: Quantity Within Tolerance, Unit Price Outside Negative Tolerance (Rejected)

**Scenario:** The quantity is within tolerance, but the unit price is below the acceptable range (negative tolerance) and is not approved.

• **Action:** The system rejects the unit price, adjusts it to match the purchase order, and generates a credit note for the difference. Additional header charges may be applied as necessary.

### Case 7: Quantity Within Tolerance, Unit Price Outside Tolerance (Positive Rejected)

**Scenario:** The quantity is within tolerance, but the unit price exceeds the acceptable range (positive tolerance) and is not approved.

• **Action:** The system rejects the invoice unit price, adjusts it to match the purchase order, and may generate a debit note to account for the overcharged amount.

### Case 8a, 9a: Quantity Outside Tolerance (Approved), Unit Price Within Tolerance

**Scenario:** The quantity on the invoice is outside the acceptable tolerance but has been approved, while the unit price remains within tolerance.

• **Action:** The system accepts the approved quantity and the unit price as per the invoice and processes the transaction accordingly.

### Case 11a: Quantity Outside Tolerance (Positive Rejected), Unit Price Within Tolerance

**Scenario:** The quantity on the invoice exceeds the acceptable range (positive) and is rejected, but the unit price is within tolerance.

• **Action:** The system adjusts the quantity to the approved level, maintaining the unit price, and processes the transaction. Any excess quantity is rejected and not invoiced.

### Case 10a: Quantity Outside Tolerance (Negative Rejected), Unit Price Within Tolerance

**Scenario:** The quantity is below the acceptable range (negative tolerance) and is not approved, though the unit price is within tolerance.

• **Action:** The system adjusts the quantity to match the approved level, keeping the unit price consistent. The transaction is processed accordingly.
