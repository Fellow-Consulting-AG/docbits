# Sub-Organizations

Creating suborganizations within a document management system serves to further organize and differentiate the structure and management of user accounts, documents, and workflows within an organization. Here are some purposes and benefits of creating suborganizations:

* **Structuring and organization:** Suborganizations make it possible to create a hierarchical structure within the document management system. This can help organize user accounts and documents by department, team, location, or other relevant criteria for clearer and more efficient management.
* **Permission management:** By creating suborganizations, administrators can set granular permissions and access controls for different groups of users. This means that specific users or groups can only access the documents and resources relevant to their respective sub-organization, improving security and privacy.
* **Workflows and Collaboration:** Suborganizations can facilitate collaboration and communication within specific teams or departments by centralizing access to shared documents, projects, or tasks. This promotes efficiency and coordination when collaborating on common projects or workflows.
* **Reporting and analysis:** By organizing user accounts and documents into sub-organizations, detailed reports and analysis can be created on the activities and performance of individual teams or departments. This allows administrators and managers to gain insight into document management system usage at an organizational level.
* **Scalability and Flexibility:** Sub-organizations provide a scalable structure that can grow with the organization's growth and changes. New teams or departments can be easily added and appropriately integrated into the existing sub-organizational scheme without affecting the overall structure of the document management system.

Overall, suborganizations enable more effective management and organization of user accounts, documents, and workflows within a document management system by improving structure, security, and collaboration.
