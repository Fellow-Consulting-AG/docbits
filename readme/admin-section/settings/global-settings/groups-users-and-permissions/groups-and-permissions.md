Setting up groups and permissions is critical to security and operational efficiency for several reasons:

* **Access control:** By assigning permissions at the group level, organizations can control access to sensitive information and resources. This helps prevent unauthorized access and data leaks by allowing only authorized users to access relevant data.
* **Differentiation of roles and responsibilities:** Different departments or teams within an organization have different tasks and responsibilities. Setting up groups makes it possible to organize users based on their roles and functions and assign them appropriate access permissions.
* **Efficiency and productivity**: By grouping users with similar access requirements, administrators can efficiently manage and update permissions. This saves time and resources as they do not have to manage each user individually but can assign permissions at the group level.
* **Compliance and data protection:** Many industries and organizations have specific compliance requirements and data protection policies that must be followed. Using groups and permissions makes it easier to implement these policies by controlling and logging access to sensitive data.
* **Flexibility and scalability:** With a well-structured group and permission system, organizations can respond flexibly to changes and easily add or remove new users or teams. This makes it easier to scale the system as the organization grows or its structure changes.

In terms of scenarios where different groups need different levels of access, there are many possible applications. Here are some examples:

* **Finance department vs. medical department:** Finance staff may need access to invoices, payroll, and budget documents, while the medical department needs access to patient records, medical reports, and treatment plans. Assigning permissions at the group level can accommodate these different access needs.
* **Employees vs. Executive level:** Operational level employees may need access to daily work documents and internal resources, while executives may need access to strategic reports, business plans, and sensitive company data. Setting up groups allows these access differences to be accommodated based on users' roles and responsibilities.
*   **External partners vs. internal employees:** External partners or contractors may need access to certain project documents or shared resources, but may not have access to sensitive internal information. By creating groups, organizations can control access rights for external users accordingly and ensure that sensitive data remains protected.



## Components of the Groups and Permissions Section

1. **Activate/Deactivate Groups and Permissions**: A toggle that allows the system administrator to enable or disable the use of groups and permissions across the platform. When turned off, the system may default to a less granular access control model.
2. **Group List**: Shows the list of available user groups within the organization. Each group can be configured with specific permissions. Administrators can add new groups by clicking the "+ New" button.
3.  **Permissions Table**:

    * Displayed once a group is selected or a new group is being configured.
    * Lists all document types recognized by the system (e.g., INVOICE, CREDIT\_NOTE, DELIVERY\_NOTE).
    * For each document type, there are checkboxes for different permissions:
      * **View**: Permission to see the document.
      * **Update**: Permission to modify the document.
      * **Delete**: Permission to remove the document from the system.
      * **First Approval**: Permission to perform the initial approval of the document.
      * **Second Approval**: Permission to perform a secondary level of approval (if applicable).
