# Purpose and Use

## Setting up table columns correctly is critical to ensure efficient data storage, querying, and reporting.

**Here are the main reasons why:**



**Space optimization:**

* Carefully selecting and arranging columns can help you minimize the amount of space your database requires.&#x20;
* This is especially important when working with large amounts of data, as unnecessary or redundant columns can waste resources.



**Data consistency:**

* By ensuring that each column only contains data that is relevant to its specific purpose, you can improve the consistency of your database.&#x20;
* This means that your data is cleaner and more reliable, which in turn improves the quality of your reporting.



**Query performance:**

* Well-designed table columns can significantly improve the performance of database queries. For example, putting indexes on frequently queried columns can help queries run faster.&#x20;
* Avoiding unnecessary columns in query results can also increase query performance.



**Easier reporting:**

* Organizing your data into meaningful column structures makes it easier to create reports and analyses.
*   Well-designed table columns can also increase the readability of reports and ensure that important information is easy to find.



**Future-proofing:**

* By setting up the right table columns from the start, you can better prepare your database for future needs.&#x20;
* You can more easily add new features and make changes to the data model without affecting existing data.



Overall, setting up table columns correctly helps improve the efficiency, consistency and performance of your database, which in turn increases the quality of your data storage, querying and reporting.
