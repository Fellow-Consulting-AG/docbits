# Using the XSLT Editor

Guide to using the XSLT Editor to create or modify transformations. Includes tips for testing and validating XSLT scripts to ensure they correctly transform document data into the required EDI format.&#x20;

## Here's a guide to using the XSLT Editor to create or modify transformations, as well as tips for testing and validating XSLT scripts:

**Opening the XSLT Editor:**

* Launch the XSLT editor of your choice. Popular options include Oxygen XML Editor, Altova XMLSpy, or simply a text editor with syntax highlighting for XSLT.&#x20;

**Creating or modifying transformations:**

* Define the rules for transforming the input data (e.g. XML) into the desired EDI format. Use XSLT templates to select the elements and attributes of the input XML and format them accordingly.
* Use XSLT functions and statements such as [xsl:template](xsl:template), [xsl:apply-templates](xsl:apply-templates), [xsl:for-each](xsl:for-each)Â´, [xsl:value-of](xsl:value-of), etc. to perform the transformations.
* Check your transformations carefully to ensure that all required data is extracted and formatted correctly.&#x20;

**Testing and validating XSLT scripts:**

* Use sample data to test your XSLT transformations. Ideally, this sample data should cover various scenarios and edge cases that may occur in the actual input data.&#x20;
* Run your XSLT scripts with the sample data and carefully check the output result. Make sure that the generated EDI output meets the expected specifications.&#x20;
* Validate your XSLT scripts against the XSLT specification to ensure they are syntactically correct and do not contain errors that could cause unexpected behavior.&#x20;
* Use tools such as XSLT debuggers to perform step-by-step testing when necessary and identify potential problems in your transformations.



&#x20;By carefully creating, testing, and validating your XSLT scripts, you can ensure that they correctly transform the input data into the required EDI format. This is critical for successful electronic data interaction between different business systems.
