# Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting document type configuration in DocBits can be complex because various factors can affect data recognition and extraction.&#x20;

### Here are some general troubleshooting tips that can help identify and resolve common issues:

### Check layout configuration&#x20;

**Check consistency:**&#x20;

* Make sure all documents of the type have a consistent layout. Variations in layout can affect recognition.

**Check zones and areas:**&#x20;

* Check that the defined zones and areas are positioned correctly and cover the relevant information.

**Update templates:**&#x20;

* If the layout of the documents changes, update the templates accordingly.

### Check field definitions and metadata&#x20;

**Field names and data types:**&#x20;

* Make sure field names are correct and data types are properly defined.

**Formatting guidelines:**&#x20;

* Check that the formatting guidelines for the fields are correct and match the actual data.

**Check required fields:**&#x20;

* Make sure all required fields are correctly recognized and filled in.

### Adjust regex patterns and extraction rules&#x20;

**Test regex patterns:**&#x20;

* Use a regex tool to test the patterns and make sure they capture the desired data correctly.

**Increase specificity:**&#x20;

* Adjust the regex patterns to be more specific and avoid misinterpretation.

**Check anchor points:**&#x20;

* Make sure the anchor points for data extraction are set correctly. If the pattern is not working correctly, check if special characters or different formats need to be considered.

### Adjust validation rules&#x20;

**Analyze error messages:**&#x20;

* Examine the error messages and log files for evidence of incorrect validations.

**Refine rules:**&#x20;

* Adjust the validation rules to make them more flexible or stricter if necessary.

**Multi-step validation:**&#x20;

* Implement additional validation steps to improve data quality.

### Improve training data and models&#x20;

**Collect representative data:**&#x20;

* Make sure the training data covers a wide range of examples that reflect all possible variations.

**Retrain models:**&#x20;

* Retrain the models regularly, especially when new document variants are added.

**Feedback loops:**&#x20;

* Use feedback loops to continuously improve the models.

### Review automation workflows &#x20;

**Review workflow steps:**&#x20;

* Review each step in the workflow to ensure that the data is processed and routed correctly.

**Analyze logs:**&#x20;

* Analyze the workflow logs to identify and resolve sources of errors.

**Collect user feedback:**&#x20;

* Ask users about their experiences and issues with the workflows to identify potential weak points.

### Review user rights and access control&#x20;

**Review access rights:**&#x20;

* Make sure the right users have access to the relevant document types and fields.

**Track changes:**&#x20;

* Check whether recent changes in access rights may have affected document processing.

**Regular review:**&#x20;

* Perform regular access rights reviews to ensure everything is configured correctly.

### General troubleshooting tips&#x20;

**Consult documentation:**&#x20;

* Use DocBits system documentation and support resources to find solutions to problems.

**Provide training:**&#x20;

* Make sure all users are adequately trained to avoid common errors.

**Updates and patches:**&#x20;

* Keep the system up to date by regularly applying updates and patches that contain bug fixes and improvements.
