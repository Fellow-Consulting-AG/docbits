# Troubleshooting

## Here is some advice on troubleshooting common scripting problems in DocBits: e.g. tips for debugging, dealing with unexpected script behavior, and performance optimization.

### Debugging tips:

**Use debugging tools:**

* Use debuggers or logging frameworks to trace the flow of your script and identify potential sources of errors.

**Step-by-step execution:**&#x20;

* Run your script step-by-step and check after each step that the expected behavior occurs.&#x20;
* This can help you pinpoint the exact time and cause of an error.

**Print intermediate results:**

* Include targeted output from variables or intermediate results in your script to check the state of the code and understand what is happening.

### Dealing with unexpected script behavior:

**Isolate the problem:**

* Try to isolate the problem to a specific place in the code or a specific input data to find the source of the unexpected behavior.

**Check external dependencies:**

Make sure that external resources or libraries are installed and configured correctly and that your script can access them properly.

**Check changes:**

* If the unexpected behavior occurs after a code change, review your recent changes and consider whether they might have caused the problem.

### Performance tuning:

**Identify bottlenecks:**

* Analyze your script to identify bottlenecks or inefficient areas that might affect performance.

**Optimize critical sections:**

* Review critical sections of your code and look for ways to optimize them, such as using more efficient algorithms or data structures.

**Consider scaling:**

* Think about the scaling of your scripts and how they behave as the load increases.&#x20;
* Test your script under different load conditions to make sure it works efficiently even under heavy use.

### Documentation and knowledge sharing:

**Document your troubleshooting steps:**

* Keep track of the steps you took to diagnose and resolve issues.&#x20;
* This can help you identify and resolve similar issues more quickly in the future.

**Seek resources and expertise:**

* Use online resources, forums, or the documentation of the scripting language you are using to get help with troubleshooting.&#x20;
* Sharing experiences with other developers can also be helpful.



Applying these tips will help you more effectively diagnose and resolve common scripting issues in DocBits and optimize the performance of your scripts.
