#### Overview

Document Sub Types are essentially specialized versions of the main document types. For example, under the main document type "Invoice," there might be sub-types like "Standard Invoice," "Pro-forma Invoice," and "Credit Invoice," each with slightly different data requirements or processing rules.

#### Key Features and Options

1. **List of Sub Types**:
   * Each row represents a sub-type of a primary document type.
   * Includes the name of the sub-type and a set of actions that can be performed on it.
2. **Actions**:
   * **Fields**: Configure which data fields are included in the sub-type and how they are managed.
   * **Edit Layout**: Modify the visual layout for how information is displayed and entered for this sub-type.
   * **Scripts**: Attach or edit scripts that execute specific operations when documents of this sub-type are processed.
   * **Copy**: Duplicate an existing sub-type configuration to use as a basis for a new one.
   * **Delete**: Remove the sub-type if it is no longer needed.
3. **Adding New Sub Types**:
   * The "+ New" button allows administrators to create new sub-types, defining unique properties and rules as needed.
