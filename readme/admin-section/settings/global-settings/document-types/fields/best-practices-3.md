# Best practices

## Here are best practices for field configuration in a document processing system, emphasizing the importance of understanding the document workflow and data requirements.



### **Understanding the document workflow:**

* Analyze your document workflow thoroughly to identify the different phases and steps a document goes through, from capture to processing to storage or release.
* Identify the specific data that needs to be captured, reviewed, processed, or extracted at each step of the workflow.

### **Identify key data points:**

* Determine the key data that is critical to your business process or analysis.
* Prioritize fields according to their importance to the business process or analysis to ensure they are captured and processed correctly.

### **Match fields to data requirements:**

* Match field properties to specific data requirements, including their type (text, date, numeric, etc.), validation rules, and any required properties such as required or read-only.
* Also consider security requirements, privacy regulations, and legal requirements when configuring field properties.

### **Consider flexibility and extensibility:**

* Design the fields to be flexible and extensible to accommodate future customizations or changes in document workflow or data requirements.
* Make sure the configuration of the fields allows new data points or changed requirements to be easily and efficiently incorporated.

### **Test and validate:**

* Perform extensive testing to ensure that the configured fields work correctly and produce the expected results.
*   Validate the field configuration by processing a large number of documents and verifying that the data captured meets the requirements.



By understanding the document workflow and data requirements and applying best practices in field configuration, you can ensure that your document processing system functions efficiently and accurately. This will help improve the quality of your data, optimize workflow, and increase the overall performance of your business.
