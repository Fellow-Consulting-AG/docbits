# Import Data: Model Training

Provide detailed instructions on how to import sample documents for training, including the format and document types to use.

**To import sample documents for training, follow these steps:**&#x20;

* **Prepare the sample documents:** Make sure the sample documents are in a supported format, such as PDF, Word, Excel, etc. These documents should cover a variety of types and formats that may be encountered in production operations of the document processing system.
* **Navigate to the import function:** Log in to the administration area of ​​the document processing system and navigate to the area where you can import new documents.&#x20;

* **Select the option to import documents:** Click the button or link to import documents. There may be an option such as "Import".&#x20;

**Amount Format:**

The amount format may vary by region, but in general there are some common conventions:

1. Currency symbol: The currency symbol is usually provided before the amount, e.g. "$" for US dollars, "€" for euros, "£" for British pounds, etc.
2. Thousands separator: In some countries, long numbers are separated by a thousand separator for better readability. In the US, a comma is commonly used (e.g. 1,000), while in many European countries a period is used (e.g. 1,000).
3. Decimal separator: The decimal separator is used to separate the integer part from the decimal places. Most English-speaking countries use a period (e.g. 10.99), while many European countries use a comma (e.g. 10.99).

#### Date Format:

The date format also varies by region, with different countries having different conventions. Here are the most common formats:

1. Day-Month-Year (DD-MM-YY or DD.MM.YY): In many European countries, the date is specified in day-month-year format. For example, "21.05.24" represents May 21, 2024.
2. Month-Day-Year (MM-DD-YY or MM/DD/YY): In the United States, the month-day-year format is often used. For example, "05/21/24" represents May 21, 2024.
3. Year-Month-Day (YY-MM-DD or YY/MM/DD): In some other countries, the year-month-day format is preferred. For example, "24/05/21" represents May 21, 2024.

It is important to note the specific format to avoid misunderstandings, especially in international communications or financial transactions.



* **Select the sample documents:** Select the sample documents you want to import. This can be done by uploading the files from your local computer or by selecting documents from an already connected location.&#x20;

* **Configure the document types and subtypes (if required):** If your system supports different document types or subtypes, assign the appropriate type to each imported document. This will help the system to categorize and process the documents correctly.



* **Start the import process:** Confirm the selection of documents and start the import process. Depending on the size and number of documents, this process may take some time.&#x20;

* **Check the import status:** Check the status of the import process to make sure that all documents were imported successfully. Make sure that no errors occurred and that the documents were processed correctly.&#x20;



* **Train the model:** After the documents are imported, use them to train the document processing system model. Perform training according to the system's instructions to make sure it can process the sample data effectively.

By regularly adding sample documents for training, you can ensure that your document processing system is always up to date and provides accurate and efficient processing.
