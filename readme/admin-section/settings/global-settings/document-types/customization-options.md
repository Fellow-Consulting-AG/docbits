# Customization Options

## The customization options for each document type in DocBits is crucial to optimize document processing and data extraction.&#x20;

### Here are the most important customization options in detail and their impact on document processing and data extraction:

1. **Layout Configuration Description:**

The layout configuration determines the structure and appearance of a document type.

**Options:**

**Templates:**&#x20;

* Upload or create document templates that define the general layout.

**Zones:**&#x20;

* Specify specific areas (zones) on the document, e.g. header, footer, content area.

**Impact:**

**Improved accuracy:**&#x20;

* By accurately defining layouts, systems can better identify where to find certain information, improving the accuracy of data extraction.

**Consistency:**&#x20;

* Ensuring that all documents of a type have a consistent layout makes processing and review easier.

2. **Field Definitions Description:**

Fields are specific data points extracted from documents.&#x20;

**Options:**

* Field name: The name of the field (e.g. "Invoice number", "Date", "Amount").
* Data type: The type of data contained in the field (e.g. text, number, date).
* Format: The format of the data (e.g. date in DD/MM/YYYY format).
* Required field: Indicates whether a field is mandatory.

**Impact:**

**Data extraction accuracy:**&#x20;

* By defining fields precisely, the correct data can be extracted precisely.

**Error reduction:**&#x20;

* Clear specification of field formats and data types reduces the likelihood of errors during data processing.

**Automated validation:**&#x20;

* Required fields and specific formats enable automatic validation of the extracted data.

3. **Extraction rules Description:**

Rules that determine how data is extracted from documents.

**Options:**

**Regular expressions:**&#x20;

* Using regular expressions to match patterns.

**Anchor points:** .&#x20;

* Using specific text anchors to identify the position of fields. Artificial intelligence: Using AI models for data extraction based on pattern recognition and machine learning

**Impact:**

**Precision:**&#x20;

* By applying specific extraction rules, data can be extracted precisely and reliably.&#x20;

**Flexibility:**&#x20;

* Customizable rules make it possible to adapt the extraction to different document layouts and contents.&#x20;

**Efficiency:**&#x20;

* Automated extraction rules reduce manual effort and speed up data processing.&#x20;



4. &#x20;**Validation rules Description:**

Rules for checking the correctness and completeness of the extracted data.&#x20;

**Options:**

* **Format check:** Validating the data format (e.g. whether a date is correctly formatted).&#x20;
* **Value check:** Checking whether the extracted values ​​are within a certain range.&#x20;
* **Cross-check:** Comparing the extracted data with other data sources or data fields in the document.&#x20;

**Impact:**

**Data quality:**&#x20;

* Ensuring that only correct and complete data is stored.&#x20;

**Error prevention:**&#x20;

* Automatic validation reduces the risk of human error.&#x20;

**Compliance:**&#x20;

* Adhering to regulations and standards through accurate data validation.&#x20;

5. &#x20;**Automation workflows Description:**

Workflows that automate the processing steps of a document type.&#x20;

**Options:**

**Approval processes:**&#x20;

* Automatic forwarding of documents for approval.&#x20;

**Notifications:**&#x20;

* Automatic notifications for certain events (e.g. receipt of an invoice).&#x20;

**Archiving:**

* Automatic archiving of documents according to certain rules. Impact:

**Increased efficiency:**&#x20;

* Automated workflows speed up processing and reduce manual effort.&#x20;

**Transparency:**&#x20;

* Clear and traceable processes increase the transparency and traceability of document processing.&#x20;

**Compliance:**&#x20;

Automated workflows ensure that all steps are carried out in accordance with internal guidelines and legal regulations.&#x20;

6. &#x20;**User rights and access control Description:**

Control of access to document types and their fields.&#x20;

**Options:**

**Role-based access control:**&#x20;

* Specify which users or user groups can access certain document types.&#x20;

**Security levels:**&#x20;

* Assign security levels to document types and fields.&#x20;

**Impact:**

**Data security:**&#x20;

* Protect sensitive data through restricted access.&#x20;

**Compliance:**&#x20;

* Compliance with data protection regulations through targeted access controls.&#x20;

**User-friendliness:**&#x20;

* Adaptation of the user interface depending on role and authorization increases user-friendliness.&#x20;

The extensive customization options for document types in DocBits enable precise control of document processing and data extraction. By carefully configuring layouts, fields, extraction and validation rules, automation workflows, and user rights, organizations can ensure that their documents are processed efficiently, accurately, and securely. These customization options go a long way in optimizing the overall performance of the document management system and meeting the specific needs of the organization.
