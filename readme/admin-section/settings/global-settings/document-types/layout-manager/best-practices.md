# Best practices

## Best practices for efficient and precise document layouts.

### Logical organization of fields:

* Group related fields together to create a logical and intuitive structure. This makes it easier for users to navigate and enter data.
* Arrange fields so that frequently used or important information is easily accessible and placed in a prominent location.

### Ensuring data completeness:

* Identify all required data fields and mark them accordingly. Ensure users are prompted to enter all necessary information to avoid incomplete records.
* Use validation rules to ensure that entered data conforms to expected formats and criteria.

### Clear labels and instructions:

* Use clear and precise labels for fields to help users enter the expected data.
* Add instructions or notes when additional information is required to ensure users provide the correct data.

### Test and optimize:

* Test the layout and data entry thoroughly to ensure that all data is captured and stored correctly. Collect feedback from users and make adjustments to continuously improve user experience and data integrity.
