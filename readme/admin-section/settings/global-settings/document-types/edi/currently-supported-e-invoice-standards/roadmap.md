# Roadmap

**Chorus Pro (France)**

  •  **Scope:** French platform for B2G invoicing, which also aligns with PEPPOL BIS and Factur-X.

  •  **Note:** While Chorus Pro is more of a platform than a format, supporting its data structures and validations might be beneficial for working with French public entities.

**Svefaktura (Sweden)**

  •  **Scope:** A legacy Swedish e-invoice format.

  •  **Basis:** Based on UBL, historically used for B2G invoicing in Sweden.

  •  **Common Version:** Svefaktura 1.0 (largely being superseded by PEPPOL BIS)

  •  **Note:** Although being phased out in favor of PEPPOL BIS, still appears in some legacy scenarios.

**OIOUBL (Denmark)**

  •  **Scope:** Widely used for B2G invoicing in Denmark.

  •  **Basis:** UBL-based format aligned with Danish national requirements.

  •  **Common Version:** OIOUBL Invoice/2.02 (and subsequent updates)

  •  **Note:** Predecessor to current EN 16931-based formats; may still be in use by Danish entities.

**EHF (Norway)**

  •  **Scope:** Norway’s national standard for electronic invoicing.

  •  **Basis:** PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 compliant; EHF (Elektronisk Handelsformat) is essentially a localized profile.

  •  **Common Version:** EHF Invoice and Credit Note 3.0

  •  **Note:** Standard format for public sector invoices in Norway, strongly linked to PEPPOL.
