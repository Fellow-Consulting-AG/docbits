# Purchase order disable statuses

## **Setting to disable PO based on statuses**&#x20;

Go to **Settings → General Settings → Document Types → More Settings → Purchase Order Section → PO Disable Statuses**

### **How it work**&#x20;

The **PO Disable Statuses** setting allows users to specify purchase order (PO) statuses that prevent invoices from being matched to those POs. If a purchase order has a status listed in this setting, it **cannot** be used for invoice matching in the PO matching screen. This will stop further processing of the PO until its status changes to one that is not disabled.

This will stop further processing of the Invoice until the status of the PO changes to one that is not disabled.\
\
By using this setting, users can ensure that purchase orders with specific statuses do not undergo further invoice processing, reducing errors and preventing unnecessary payments.\


### **How to Identify a Disabled Purchase Order**

In the **PO Matching** screen, a disabled purchase order appears **crossed out**. This visually indicates that the PO is currently restricted from being matched due to its status.
