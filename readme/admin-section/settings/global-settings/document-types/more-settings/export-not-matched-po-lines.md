# Export not matched PO lines

Go to **Settings** → **General Settings** → **Document Types** → **More Settings** → **Purchase Order Section** → **Export not matched PO lines**

how does it work:

when not enabled DocBits will only export matched Invoice lines that are matched mit a purchase order&#x20;

when enabled DocBits will export Invoice lines of an invoice that are not matched to the purchase order

For example you have a purchase order with 3 lines but get a Invoice with only 2 Lines&#x20;

Now you match the lines 1 to 1 and have one purchase order line over when this setting is not active you  &#x20;
