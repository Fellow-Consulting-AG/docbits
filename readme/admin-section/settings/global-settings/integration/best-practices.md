# Best practices

Best practices for configuring and maintaining integration settings help ensure the efficiency, security, and reliability of the integration between DocBits and your Identity Service Provider (IdP).&#x20;

**Here are some best practices:**&#x20;

* **Regularly review settings:** Perform regular reviews of integration settings to ensure all configurations are correct and up-to-date. Changes to systems or policies may require updates to the integration.&#x20;
* **Certificate and metadata updates:** Monitor SAML certificate and metadata expiration dates and update them in a timely manner to avoid service disruptions. Use automated processes or reminders to ensure no expiration dates are missed.
* **Security-conscious credential management:** Treat credentials such as API keys or certificates with the utmost confidentiality and protect them from unauthorized access. Use secure methods for storing and exchanging credentials to ensure the integrity of the integration.&#x20;
* **Documentation and logging of changes:** Record and log all changes to integration settings in detailed documentation. This allows you to track changes and revert to previous configurations when needed.&#x20;
* **Training administrators:** Ensure that the administrators responsible for configuring and maintaining integration settings have the necessary knowledge and skills. Provide training and resources to ensure they understand and can implement integration best practices.&#x20;
* **Setting up alerts and notifications:** Configure alerts and notifications for critical events such as certificate expiration dates or failed authentication attempts. This will allow you to identify potential issues early and proactively address them.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that the integration between DocBits and your identity service provider works smoothly, is secure, and meets the needs of your organization.
