# Managing Notifications

To edit, disable, or delete existing notifications and adapt them to changes in document processing workflows or user responsibilities, you can do the following:

**Navigate to notification settings:** Go to your system's settings where you can manage notifications. You can find these in the “Settings” section, “Global Settings” and then under “Email notification”.

**Look for the list of existing notifications:** In the notification settings you will find a list of existing notifications. This list shows you all notifications that are currently set up.

**Edit a notification:** To edit an existing notification, find the notification in the list and select the edit option. This allows you to change the notification settings, such as the document type, status, triggering events or recipients.

**Turn off a notification:** If you want to temporarily turn off a notification, find the notification in the list and select the option to turn it off. This will temporarily stop the notification without deleting it, so you can reactivate it later if necessary.

**Delete a notification:** To permanently remove a notification, find the notification in the list and select the delete option. This will completely remove the notification from the system and cannot be restored.

**Adapt to Changes:** Periodically review your notification settings and adjust as necessary to reflect changes in document processing workflows or user responsibilities. This could include updating notifications due to new events, changed responsibilities, or other organizational changes.

**Save the changes:** After making your changes, don't forget to save them for them to take effect.

By regularly reviewing and adjusting your notification settings, you can ensure that your notifications always meet current needs and workflows. This helps ensure efficient communication and ensures that the right people are notified of important events in a timely manner.
