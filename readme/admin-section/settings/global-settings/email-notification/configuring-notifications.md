* **Delay**: Enter the desired amount of time to specify the delay time before sending the notification. This could be done in minutes, hours or days depending on your system settings.
* By configuring a delay time before sending the notification, users have enough time for any cancellations or corrections before the alert is issued. This can help prevent errors and improve user experience.

* **Email Address**: Enter the email addresses of the recipients to whom the notification should be sent. Users can enter multiple email addresses to specify multiple recipients.
