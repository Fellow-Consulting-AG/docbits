# Troubleshooting

These are some tips and additional delayed notification troubleshooting steps you can take to resolve delays in notification delivery:

## Delayed notifications:

* **Check network delays**:&#x20;
* Make sure the network over which notifications are sent is not congested or disrupted. Network problems such as packet loss or delays can affect email delivery.



* **Email Queue Monitoring:**&#x20;
* Check the email server queue to determine whether notifications are being queued and sent properly. A large number of emails in the queue may indicate problems with the email server.



* **SMTP configuration verification:**
* &#x20;Verify that the SMTP configuration is correct and that the email server is properly configured to send outgoing emails. Check the authentication settings and server address to ensure they are correct.



* **Check firewalls and security settings:**&#x20;
* Check firewall settings and other security settings to ensure that the email server is properly configured to send outgoing email and that no ports used for email are blocked. Shipping is required.



* **Server utilization check:**&#x20;
* Check the utilization of the server hosting the document management system to ensure that there are no resource bottlenecks that could affect the delivery of notifications.



By performing these additional checks, you can identify potential causes of delayed notifications and take appropriate action to optimize notification delivery and ensure users are informed in a timely manner.
