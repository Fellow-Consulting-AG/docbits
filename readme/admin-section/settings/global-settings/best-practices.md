# Best practices

## Here are some best practices for setting up permissions.

### Least Privilege Principle:

* Grant users only the minimum permissions they need to do their jobs.&#x20;
* Avoid granting excessive permissions to minimize the risk of data leakage or misuse.

### Role-based access control (RBAC):

* Assign permissions to users based on their roles or functions in the organization.&#x20;
* This simplifies permission management and ensures that users can only access the resources relevant to their respective role.

### Regularly review permissions:

* Regularly review permission settings to ensure they meet current requirements and processes.&#x20;
* Adapt permissions to changes in personnel roles or document processing processes.

### Permissions documentation:

* Maintain documentation of all permission settings, including assigned permissions for users and groups.&#x20;
* This makes it easier to manage and review permissions and ensure compliance with policies and regulations.

### Implement access policies:

* Define clear access policies and procedures that specify who has access to which resources and how permissions are managed and reviewed.&#x20;
* Educate employees on the importance of permissions and compliance with access policies.

### Monitor and log access activities:

* Implement monitoring and logging tools to track access activities and detect suspicious activity.&#x20;
*   This enables faster response to security incidents and better monitoring of access policy compliance.



By following these best practices, you can ensure that your permission settings are appropriately restrictive to keep your data safe, while also promoting operational efficiency for your organization.
