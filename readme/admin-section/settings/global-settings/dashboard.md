## Overview

The Dashboard settings are designed to help administrators control the data presentation and interaction within the DocBits dashboard. These settings determine what information is immediately available upon logging in, ensuring that users have quick access to the most relevant data for their tasks.

## Key Features and Options

### **General Dashboard Settings**:

* **Reset filters**: Allows for the configuration of when dashboard filters should reset, such as after document upload, document restart, or document export. This helps in maintaining a clean slate for data viewing according to specific workflow stages.
* **Dashboard data**: Controls whether the dashboard should automatically load data upon user access, which can help in reducing load times and improving user experience by only loading data when needed.
