Purpose: This Docbits card is designed to streamline the verification process of invoices by comparing the total calculated price from the invoice against the corresponding purchase order.

Functionality:

* Combined Price of Quantity Difference: The card calculates the total price by multiplying the quantity of each item listed on the invoice by the price per unit and then subtracts this total from the amount listed on the related purchase order.
* Operator Value: Users can set conditions to determine how the calculated total price difference should be compared to the purchase order amount. The following operators are available:
*
  * Equals (=): Checks if the total invoice amount is exactly the same as the purchase order amount.
  * Not Equal (â‰ ): Verifies that the total invoice amount differs from the purchase order amount.
  * Greater Than (>): Ensures the invoice amount is greater than the purchase order amount.
  * Less Than (<): Confirms the invoice amount is less than the purchase order amount.

Usage: This card is particularly useful for ERP Managers and financial accountants who need to automate and error-proof the reconciliation of invoices against purchase orders, ensuring financial accuracy and preventing overpayments or underpayments.

Example Scenario:

* An invoice lists a total of 100 units of a product at $50 per unit, totaling $5000. The related purchase order authorized a purchase of $4500. Using the "Greater Than" operator, the card identifies and flags the discrepancy for review.

By using the "Compare with Purchase Order" card, users can automatically ensure that payments are consistent with purchase agreements, saving time and reducing human error in financial processing.
