## **Purpose:**

This DocBits card compares today's date to a specified date, allowing workflows to execute based on the relationship between the current date and the provided date. It is particularly useful for time-based automation, deadline management, or triggering scheduled tasks.

## **Functionality:**

* **Date Comparison:** This card evaluates today's date against a specified date using the following conditions:
  * **Equals (=):** Checks if today's date matches the specified date.
  * **Not Equals (≠):** Ensures today's date is different from the specified date.
  * **Greater Than (>):** Confirms that today's date is after the specified date.
  * **Greater or Equals (≥):** Ensures today's date is on or after the specified date.
  * **Lesser Than (<):** Checks if today's date is before the specified date.
  * **Less or Equals (≤):** Ensures today's date is on or before the specified date.
* **Date Input:** Users provide the date to compare against today's date.

## **Usage:**

This card is ideal for workflows involving deadlines, reminders, or time-sensitive conditions, ensuring actions are taken or restricted based on the current date.

## **Example Scenario:**

* A user configures the card to check if **today is greater than (>) "2024-11-15"**. If the condition is met, the workflow triggers a follow-up notification for overdue tasks. If not, the workflow continues without interruption.

By using the "Today's Date Validation" card, organizations can automate time-based processes, meet deadlines efficiently, and maintain workflow accuracy.
