## **Purpose**:

This DocBits card enables verification of the order type on a purchase order, ensuring that it aligns with specified criteria.

## **Functionality**:

* **Order Type Comparison**: This card compares the order type of the purchase order to a specified value, allowing users to verify whether the order type meets certain conditions.
* **Any/All Selection**: Users can choose to apply the comparison to **any** (at least one selected order type matches) or **all** (all selected order types match) specified order types.
* **Operator**: Users can set conditions for comparing the order type in the purchase order. Available operators include:
  * **Equals (=)**: Confirms that the order type in the purchase order matches the specified type.
  * **Not Equal (â‰ )**: Ensures that the order type in the purchase order does not match the specified type.

## **Usage**:

This card is particularly valuable for procurement teams, inventory planners, and operations managers who need to categorize and prioritize orders accurately. By ensuring that order types match the intended classifications, users can streamline order handling, optimize resource allocation, and adhere to service level agreements.

## **Example Scenario**:

* A purchase order is categorized as "IGR." The system uses the "Equals" operator to verify that this order type aligns with the intended classification for processing.&#x20;

By using the "Compare with Purchase Order: Order Type" card, organizations can automate the validation of order types, ensuring consistency in processing priorities and reducing manual classification errors.
