## **Purpose:**

This DocBits card performs a comparison between values in two specified columns within a table, based on a chosen condition. It’s useful for scenarios that require validating relationships between data points, such as quality control, data consistency checks, or compliance verification.

## **Functionality:**

* **Column Comparison:** This card allows users to set conditions to compare values between two columns in the same table.
* **Operators:** The following operators are available to define the comparison:
  * **Equals (=):** Checks if values in the two columns are exactly equal.
  * **Not Equals (≠):** Ensures values in the two columns are not equal.
  * **Greater Than (>):** Confirms that values in the first column are greater than those in the second column.
  * **Greater or Equals (≥):** Ensures values in the first column are greater than or equal to those in the second column.
  * **Lesser Than (<):** Checks if values in the first column are less than those in the second column.
  * **Less or Equals (≤):** Ensures values in the first column are less than or equal to those in the second column.
* **Table and Column Selection:** Users specify the table and the two columns they wish to compare.

## **Usage:**

This card is ideal for data analysts, quality control teams, or compliance officers who need to ensure that values in one column relate to values in another according to specific rules, allowing for advanced data validation.

## **Example Scenario:**

* A user configures the card to check if values in the "Current Stock" column are **greater than or equal to (≥)** values in the "Minimum Stock Level" column in the "Inventory" table. If all values meet this condition, the workflow proceeds, confirming that stock levels are adequate.

By using the "Column Value Comparison" card, organizations can ensure data consistency, maintain quality standards, and validate data relationships within tables.
