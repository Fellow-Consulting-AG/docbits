## **Purpose:**

This DocBits card verifies if items in a dataset meet specified conditions based on their shelf life. The card allows users to choose between "any" or "all" items for validation and supports various comparison operators. This is ideal for scenarios where workflow decisions depend on the shelf life of items, such as quality control, inventory management, or compliance checks

## **Functionality:**

* **Shelf Life Validation:** This card checks the shelf life of items against a specified condition. Users can choose to validate **any** item or **all** items in the dataset and apply various comparison operators to define the condition.
* **Item Selection:** Users can choose between:
  * **Any Item:** The card triggers if at least one item meets the specified shelf life condition.
  * **All Items:** The card triggers only if all items meet the specified shelf life condition.
* **Operators:** The following operators are available to set the shelf life condition:
  * **Equals (=):** Checks if the shelf life is exactly equal to the specified value.
  * **Not Equals (≠):** Ensures the shelf life is not equal to the specified value.
  * **Greater Than (>):** Confirms that the shelf life is greater than the specified value.
  * **Greater or Equals (≥):** Ensures the shelf life is greater than or equal to the specified value.
  * **Less Than (<):** Checks if the shelf life is less than the specified value.
  * **Less or Equals (≤):** Ensures the shelf life is less than or equal to the specified value.



## **Usage:**

This card is suitable for quality control teams, inventory managers, or compliance officers who need to ensure items meet specific shelf life requirements before proceeding with further actions or workflows.

## **Example Scenario:**

* A user configures the card to check if **all items** have a shelf life **greater than or equal to 30 days**. If every item meets this condition, the workflow proceeds, confirming that all items have sufficient shelf life for sale or distribution.

By using the "Shelf Life Validation" card, organizations can enforce shelf life standards, maintain product quality, and ensure workflow accuracy based on item shelf life conditions.
