## Purpose:

The **"AI Calculation for Cost Increase Surcharges"** workflow card uses AI to automatically compute surcharge amounts based on cost increases. It ensures consistent and accurate surcharge calculations, streamlining workflows and reducing manual effort.

## Components of the Card:

* **Cost Increase Factor**
  * **Description:** The multiplier or percentage applied to the base cost to calculate the surcharge.
  * **Detail:** Determines the surcharge amount based on the cost increase (e.g., a factor of 1.10 for a 10% increase).
* **Base Cost Field**
  * **Description:** The field containing the original cost value used as the basis for the surcharge calculation.
  * **Detail:** Selected automatically or defined within the workflow for reference during the calculation.
* **Surcharge Field**
  * **Description:** The field where the AI-calculated surcharge value is stored.
  * **Detail:** This field reflects the calculated surcharge, making it available for further processing or reporting.

## Functionality:

**Condition Evaluation:**

* The card activates only if both the **"Where"** and **"And Sections"** conditions evaluate as true.
* If either condition evaluates as false, no surcharge calculation is performed.

**AI-Driven Calculation:**

* The system applies the **Cost Increase Factor** to the **Base Cost Field** to calculate the surcharge.
* The result is stored in the **Surcharge Field**, ensuring accessibility for subsequent workflow steps.

## Conclusion:

The **"AI Calculation for Cost Increase Surcharges"** workflow card automates the application of surcharges based on cost increases. By leveraging AI for precision and consistency, this card eliminates manual calculations, enhances efficiency, and supports accurate cost management in automated workflows.
