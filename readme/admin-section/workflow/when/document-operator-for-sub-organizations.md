**Functionality**

* **Document Identification**: The card first identifies the document(s) that need to be processed. This identification could be based on document type, source, date, or any other metadata.

  * **Approve**: Routing the document for necessary approvals within the sub-organization.

* **Configuration**: Users set up the card by specifying the operator and the sub-organization. They might also define specific rules or triggers for when the card should activate.
* **Monitoring**: Users can monitor the card's activity via a dashboard that shows ongoing and completed operations, providing transparency into document handling processes.
