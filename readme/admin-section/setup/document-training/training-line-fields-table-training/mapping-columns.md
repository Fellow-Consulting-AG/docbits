# Mapping Columns

Mapping columns is a crucial step in accurate table extraction using DocBits. Once you’ve extracted data from a document, you can map the extracted columns with the columns given by DocBits. This ensures that the extracted data is correctly placed in the corresponding columns.

To map columns, simply select the header of a column in the extraction view. A dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to select the column you want to map. If you’ve mapped a column incorrectly, you can easily remap it by clicking the dropdown menu again.
