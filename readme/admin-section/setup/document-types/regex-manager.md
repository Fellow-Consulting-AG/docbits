# Regex Manager

This feature by DocBits gives you an alternative to model classification as it allows you to write searchable regular expressions for a document type for classification and other purposes.

Document Type: The Regex Manager allows you to write regular expressions and this regex will then be searched for in the document, if it finds a match to the regex of a defined document, it then classifies that document to the corresponding document type. For example, if you wrote a regular expression to find “Gutschrift”. If DocBits found this term in a document it would classify that document as a credit note.

Document Origin: This lets DocBits know the country of origin of a document through regular expressions. For example, if a regular expression for a Spanish document contains the term “Factura”. If DocBits searches a document and finds this term then it would know that the document is of Spanish origin and classify it as such.
