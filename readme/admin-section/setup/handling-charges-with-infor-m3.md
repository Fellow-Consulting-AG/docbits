| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1           | External Charges Not on PO but on Invoice (Accepted)                                 | External charges appear on the invoice but are not listed on the PO. These charges are accepted.                                       | Charges will be posted against Accounting Rule PP20-228 based on the cost element sent by DocBits.                                                                                                                                        |
| 2           | External Charges Not on PO but on Invoice (Not Accepted)                             | External charges appear on the invoice but are not listed on the PO. These charges are not accepted or approved.                       | The total invoice value is recorded with a header charge for non-approved charges. Additionally, a debit note is created for these charges.                                                                                               |
| 3           | External Charges on Invoice Greater or Lesser than PO (Within Tolerance)             | External charges on the invoice are greater or lesser than those on the PO but within the accepted tolerance.                          | Extra charges are posted against Accounting Rule PP20-228 based on the cost element sent by DocBits.                                                                                                                                      |
| 4           | External Charges on Invoice Greater than PO (Outside Tolerance, Not Approved)        | External charges on the invoice are greater than those on the PO and outside the accepted tolerance, and they are not approved.        | The invoice is recorded with the total invoice amount. An additional non-approved charge is added as a header charge, and a debit note is created for this additional charge.                                                             |
| 5           | External Charges on Invoice Greater than PO (Outside Tolerance, Approved in DocBits) | External charges on the invoice are greater than those on the PO and outside the accepted tolerance, and they are approved in DocBits. | Extra charges are posted against PP20-228. Two options considered:\<br>- If APS900 tolerance > DocBits, extra charges automatically posted.\<br>- If APS900 tolerance = DocBits, extra charges posted with new charge elements not on PO. |
| 6           | External Charges on Invoice Lesser than PO (Outside Tolerance, Not Approved)         | External charges on the invoice are lesser than those on the PO and outside the accepted tolerance, and they are not approved.         | The invoice is posted as unapproved in APS110. The AP team adjusts the charges through the Invoice Control option in APS110, which calls APS360.                                                                                          |
| 7           | External Charges on PO and No Charge on Invoice                                      | External charges are listed on the PO, but there are no charges on the invoice.                                                        | The invoice is posted as unapproved in APS110. The AP team adjusts the charges through the Invoice Control option in APS110, which calls APS360.                                                                                          |

## Example for Scenario 5

| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Line 1         | $6000    | $6000                  |
| Freight (E001) | $1000    | $3000                  |
| **Total**      | $7000    | $9000                  |

**Tolerance of Freight:** $100 approved automatically in M3 (APS900) and DocBits. Total invoice value of $9000 approved (with charges) manually.

**APS451 (Invoice Line):**

* Line Type 1 (Invoice Line): $9000
* Line Type 5 (Line Charge): $1000 (Element: E001 for Freight on PO $1000)
* Line Type 5 (Line Charge): $2000 (Element: E101 for Freight on PO $0)
