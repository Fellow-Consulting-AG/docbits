#### Supplier Permissions <a href="#supplier-permissions" id="supplier-permissions"></a>

This is where you can manage all vendors by grouping them, making it easier to manage all suppliers. Users can also be assigned to the various supplier groups you create in this area.

**Supplier Group**

In order to make managing all vendors easier, in this section, you can create groups and assign suppliers to these groups based on their geographical location, type of vendor, etc. The choice is yours!

#### Email Templates <a href="#email-templates" id="email-templates"></a>

In this section you can upload various email templates as these will be the structure of the emails received by the supplier when you invite them to join the supplier portal. The required templates include: invitation, approval, registration completion and rejection as these are all the possible emails a supplier could receive. In order to upload a template, click on +New.

#### Supplier Layout <a href="#supplier-layout" id="supplier-layout"></a>

You can customise the layout of the registration form that the vendors you invite will see when registering for the supplier portal. This means you can add or remove fields depending on what is required from the suppliers you invite. The supplier layout builder works the exact same as the document type layout builder, for more information on this, click [here](document-types/layout-builder.md).

Below you can see that you are able to configure multiple layouts depending on your needs.

<div align="left">

</div>

Within the layout, you are able to add dropdown lists which can be created using the [List of Values](../settings/document-processing/list-of-values.md) feature.

**KEEP IN MIND**

Only values that exist in INFOR may be used in these lists in order for exporting to work. In the example shown above, the values selectable for the “Supplier Group” field all exist within INFOR. The same principle follows for all lists whether it be for payment terms, currencies, etc. To ensure no issues while exporting, first consult the values stored within INFOR before configuring these lists.

#### Supplier General Settings <a href="#supplier-general-settings" id="supplier-general-settings"></a>

Here is where you are able to upload your company logo or alternative which will be displayed at the header of all email templates sent as well as on the DocBits login screen once suppliers begin the registration process. If left empty, the standard DocBits logo will be displayed.

Supplier Portal Additional Invitation Fields: This option enables you to add additional fields to the invitation you send out to vendors, a list of fields are made available to you as shown below.
