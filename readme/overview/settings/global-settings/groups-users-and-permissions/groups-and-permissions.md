# Groups and Permissions

**What is a group?**

A group is a set of users that can be granted specific permissions for one or multiple document types. The groups can be created, changed and deleted by the organization admins. Every organization admin has the rights to do this.

If no group is configured all privileges are granted to the users within the organization.

**Groups and privileges management**

Groups are managed in DocBits under Settings > Global Settings > Groups, Users and Permissions > Groups and Permissions
