# IMAP

Here you just need to enter the required information for your email provider, encryption, server name, port, username, email address, password as well as the email folder.

Things to Note

* Input all needed information into the UI. Other information like the server, port, etc. Depends on the host (a quick Google search should help).
* Folder and Move-Imported have the same Function here. Folder can not be disabled, but will use Inbox by default if left empty.
