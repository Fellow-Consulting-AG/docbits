Purpose: This Docbits card facilitates the detailed comparison of unit prices on invoices against those specified in the corresponding purchase orders. It enhances accuracy in financial reporting by ensuring adherence to agreed pricing.

Functionality:

* Unit Price Combined with Fields: This card calculates the total amount for a specific item by combining the unit price with additional specified fields from the invoice. The combined total is then compared against the purchase order's recorded unit price for that item.
* Operator Value: Users can set specific conditions for how the invoice's combined unit price should be compared to the purchase order's unit price. Available operators include:
*
  * Equals (=): Verifies that the combined invoice price matches the price on the purchase order.
  * Not Equal (â‰ ): Ensures the combined invoice price does not match the price on the purchase order.
  * Greater Than (>): Checks if the combined invoice price exceeds the price on the purchase order.
  * Less Than (<): Confirms the combined invoice price is below the price on the purchase order.

Usage: This card is particularly valuable for ERP Managers and financial accountants tasked with maintaining stringent control over purchasing and payment processes. It ensures that invoiced prices conform to those agreed upon in purchase orders, thereby mitigating financial discrepancies.

Example Scenario:

* An invoice presents a unit price of $50 for a product. The "field name" specified includes an additional handling fee of $5 per unit. When combined, the total per unit amounts to $55. Using the "Equals" operator with a value set to $55, the card verifies that the invoiced price aligns with the purchase order, ensuring agreement compliance.

By deploying the "Compare with Purchase Order: Unit Price Combined" card, businesses can automate the verification of pricing accuracy against purchase orders, streamlining financial operations and safeguarding against overcharges.
