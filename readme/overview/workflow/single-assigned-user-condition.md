**Purpose**

This workflow card facilitates operations based on the assignment of a task or document to a single, specific user. Using a direct conditional logic approach, it manages workflows that require targeted user engagement, ensuring precision in user-based task handling.

**Components of the Card**

1. **Operator**
   * **Description**: Specifies the logic to apply to the user assignment.
   * **Options**:
     * **IS**: Triggers the operation if the assigned user of the document or task matches the specified user.
     * **IS NOT**: Triggers the operation if the assigned user does not match the specified user.
2. **User**
   * **Description**: Allows selection of a single user against whom the assigned user will be compared.
   * **Detail**: This involves a simple dropdown or autocomplete field where one user can be selected at a time.

**Functionality**

* **User Assignment Identification**: Identifies the user currently assigned to a specific task or document.
* **Condition Evaluation**:
  * For the **IS** operator, the card checks if the assigned user is the same as the user selected.
  * For the **IS NOT** operator, it verifies that the assigned user is different from the selected user.
* **Action Execution**:
  * **True Condition**: If the assignment meets the set condition (IS or IS NOT), it triggers predefined actions, which could include moving forward with approvals, initiating further tasks, sending notifications, or other related workflows.
  * **False Condition**: If the condition fails, the system can reroute the task, hold it for review, or trigger alternative predefined actions.

**User Interactions**

* **Setup and Configuration**: Users set up the card by choosing an operator and selecting a user from the user field. This setup should be straightforward, ensuring easy user selection and configuration.
* **Monitoring and Reporting**: Offers tools for monitoring the cardâ€™s performance, such as tracking which tasks are triggered by specific user assignments and the outcomes of these triggers.
* **Error Handling and Notifications**: Provides mechanisms to alert users if tasks are incorrectly assigned or if operational errors occur due to assignment issues.

#### Conclusion

The "Single Assigned User Condition" workflow card is essential for precise, user-specific document and task management within an ERP system.
