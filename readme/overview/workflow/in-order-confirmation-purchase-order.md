When an order confirmation is received, this card triggers a comparison against its linked purchase order. It scrutinizes details such as item IDs, quantities, and prices to confirm alignment.

#### Purpose

* **Accuracy**: Ensures received goods or services will match the original order specifications.
* **Efficiency**: Automates the matching process, reducing manual checks and streamlining order processing.

#### Use Case

Ideal for ERP Managers and Financial Accountants who oversee order accuracy and supplier compliance.

#### Implementation

1. **Configuration**: Define key fields for comparison (e.g., item ID, quantity, price).
2. **Automation Setup**: Automate the comparison process upon order confirmation receipt.
3. **Alerts**: Configure alerts for mismatches requiring manual review.

This card is a cornerstone for validating that the procurement process proceeds based on accurately confirmed orders.
