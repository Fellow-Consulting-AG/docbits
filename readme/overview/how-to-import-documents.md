If you’re looking to import documents manually into [DocBit](https://docbits.com/doc/docbits-getting-started/)s, follow these simple steps:

* Click on the Upload button on the DocBits [Dashboard](https://docbits.com/doc/docbits-dashboard/).
* A window will appear where you can upload your documents via file browser or drag and drop. You can upload up to 10 documents at once.
* To upload documents via file browser, click on the Upload Documents button and select the files you want to upload. Once you’ve selected the files, click on Confirm to start the upload process.
* Alternatively, you can drag and drop your files onto the DocBits import window.
* After the files have been uploaded, they will have the initial [status](https://docbits.com/doc/docbits-dashboard/document-status/) of “Running”. During this time, the upload is being processed and editing the file is not possible. The processing time may vary depending on the size and complexity of the file.
* Once the file has been processed, it will receive the [status](https://docbits.com/doc/docbits-dashboard/document-status/) of “Ready For Validation”. You can now start the [validation](https://docbits.com/doc/document-validation/) process.
