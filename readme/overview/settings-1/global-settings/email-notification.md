In this you can define a custom name for the notification, select the document type and status as well as the time unit and enter the email address of the person who should receive the corresponding notification.

The following statuses can be selected

* Ready For Validation
* Pending Approval
* Pending Second Approval

**Time Units**

* Minutes
* Hours
* Days

The Delay has to be set to a minimum of 5 minutes as the email server will need that time to respond. The email will be sent after selected time duration, if document status remains unchanged.
