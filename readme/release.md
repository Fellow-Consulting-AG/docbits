In the upcoming release, a significant enhancement to the classification and extraction capabilities will be introduced, specifically aimed at table lines within documents. This new feature allows users to define whether a line in a table represents a charge. This functionality is particularly useful in detailed financial documents, such as invoices, where distinguishing between different types of transactions—such as charges, taxes, or fees—is crucial for accurate processing and record-keeping.

**Key Points for Release Notes:**

* **Enhanced Table Line Classification**: Users can now specify if a particular line in a document table is a charge, improving the accuracy and granularity of data extraction.
