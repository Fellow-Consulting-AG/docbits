# Supplier Portal

## Overview

This page explains how to activate and use the **Supplier Portal**, as well as where to find all relevant settings. The Supplier Portal allows you to invite suppliers to **DocBits**. Once access is granted, suppliers can log in to view the status of their **Purchase Orders** and **Invoices** directly within **DocBits**.

## How to Activate the Supplier Portal

1.  Go to **Settings → Document Processing → Module**.

## Supplier Settings

Once the **Supplier Portal** feature is enabled, a new **Supplier Settings** section will appear at the bottom of the **Settings** menu.

[**Supplier General Settings**](../../settings/supplier-setting/supplier-general-settings.md): Here, you can customize the **Supplier Portal** by uploading your company logo—displayed in the header of all email templates—and by managing legal documents such as the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

[**Email Templates**](../../settings/supplier-setting/editing-email-templates.md)**:** Here you can create and test the invitation email templates that will be sent to invited suppliers.

[**Supplier Layout**](../../settings/supplier-setting/supplier-layout.md)**:** Here you can create and manage the layouts that define which information new suppliers must provide during the registration process.

[**Export Configuration**](../../settings/supplier-setting/export-configuration-for-supplier-portal-for-m3.md): Here you can define how data is mapped and synchronized between the **Supplier Portal** and the **Infor M3** system using ION and IDM mapping files.

[**Supplier Permissions**](../../settings/supplier-setting/supplier-permissions.md): Here you can configure the permissions that suppliers will have within the **Supplier Portal**. You can also group suppliers, making it easier to manage access and settings across multiple suppliers.

A detailed guide to all Supplier Settings can be found [here](../../settings/supplier-setting/).
