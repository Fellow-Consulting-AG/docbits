# Save and Delete Rules

If you’re using DocBits for document/table extraction, it’s important to save and delete rules properly to ensure your data is extracted accurately. This guide will walk you through the process.

## Save Rules

Once you’ve trained a document in DocBits and defined all the rules for table extraction, you can save those rules for future imports. This means that the tables in your documents will be extracted automatically, without any manual training required.

To save your rules, simply click the “SAVE RULES” button. You’ll see a rule indicator that shows how many rules have been defined and saved for that document.

## Delete Rules

If you need to delete rules for a document, you can do so using the “DELETE RULES” button. This may be necessary if rules have been saved incorrectly or if you need to retrain a document.

However, it’s important to note that deleting rules will affect all documents with the same or similar format. This means that you’ll need to retrain those documents from scratch. So, be sure to use this feature with caution.
