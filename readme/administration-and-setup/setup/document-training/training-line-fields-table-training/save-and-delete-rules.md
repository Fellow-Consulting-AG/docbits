# Save and Delete Rules

Once you’ve completed the training or correction of a table, it’s important to **save your rules** so that DocBits can apply them automatically to future documents from the same supplier.

### Saving Rules

After defining all columns and corrections:

1. Click the **SAVE RULES** button at the top.
2. A rule counter will confirm how many extraction rules have been saved.

This ensures DocBits will automatically use your trained layout the next time it sees a similar document.

### Deleting Rules

You can remove saved rules using the **DELETE RULES** button if they were configured incorrectly or if the document layout has changed significantly.
