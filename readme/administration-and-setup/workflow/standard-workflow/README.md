#### Overview of Workflow Components:

* **AP Invoice Email**: The process likely begins with an invoice received via email.
* **DocBits**: This tool might be used for initial document management tasks such as capturing and digitizing invoices.
* **Finance Review**: Invoices undergo a finance review where decisions are made regarding their validity and accuracy.

#### Steps in the Workflow:

1. **Initial Review**:
   * Invoices are received and initially processed using DocBits.
   * They are then reviewed by the finance team to ensure they are removed from the workflow if they are complete, or pushed forward for further processing.
2. **PO vs Non-PO Invoices**:
   * The workflow distinguishes between PO-related and non-PO invoices.
   * Non-PO invoices are routed for further approval or rejection based on predefined criteria like supplier ID, quantity, unit price, and item number.
3. **Matching and Mismatching**:
   * Invoices are checked against goods receipts to ensure that details match (like supplier ID and quantity).
   * If mismatches occur, the invoice is subject to further review and possibly rejection.
4. **Finance and Buyer Review**:
   * For PO-related invoices, a detailed matching process is conducted involving a buyer review.
   * Adjustments to purchase orders or goods receipts might be required.
5. **Final Decisions**:
   * Invoices that pass all checks are approved and integrated into financial systems for record-keeping.
   * Rejected invoices trigger notifications, and a new invoice may be requested by the buyer.
6. **Integration with Infor IDM & LN+M3**:
   * Approved invoices are likely sent to Infor's IDM for document management and LN for ledger noting.
   * This integration ensures that all financial records are up-to-date and that the workflow seamlessly feeds into the broader ERP system.

#### Decision Points:

* Throughout the workflow, there are various decision points where an invoice might be approved, rejected, or sent back for additional information. Notifications are sent out after delays, ensuring timely processing.
