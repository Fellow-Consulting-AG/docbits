# Basic Task Creation

## Card: tasks_create / Create Task and Assign to User

### Purpose

### When to Use
- Invoice needs specific person's review
- Approval required from named individual
- Handoff to specific team member

### Parameters

**Title**
The task name/subject
```
Example: "Review Invoice #INV-2025-001 for approval"
```

**Description**
Details about the task
```
Example: "Invoice from Supplier ABC needs review.
Amount: €5000
Deadline: 2025-10-30
Please verify pricing and quality."
```

**Priority**
- 🔴 **High**: Urgent, do immediately
- 🟡 **Medium**: Normal priority
- 🟢 **Low**: Can be done later

**Assigned User**
Who gets the task
```
Example: John Smith (Finance Manager)
```

**Email Notification**
Send email alert to assigned person?
```
✅ Yes: Person gets email
❌ No: Task only in system
```

### Example
```
Condition: "Invoice amount > €10,000"
    ↓
Create Task:
- Title: "High-Value Invoice Review Required"
- Description: "Invoice #INV-2025-789 for €15,000 needs approval"

```

## Card: ACTION_TASK_FOR_GROUP / Create Task for Group

### Purpose
Creates a task and assigns it to a group (all members can see it)

### When to Use
- Multiple people can do the task
- Task for team, not individual
- First person available should handle

### Difference from Individual Task
```
Individual Task:
- Only John sees it
- John must do it
- Others can't see it

Group Task:
- Everyone in group sees it
- Any group member can claim it
- Distributed workload
```

### Example Workflow
```
Document arrives
    ↓
Condition: "Is supplier new?"
    ↓
Create Task for Procurement Team:
- Title: "Verify New Supplier Details"
- Description: "Please validate supplier information"
- Priority: Medium
- Group: Procurement Team (10 members)
- Notify: Yes
    ↓
All 10 procurement team members see task
First person available takes it
```

---

## Card: ACTION_DECISION_TREE_CREATE_TASKS

### Purpose
Creates tasks based on decision table logic

### How It Works
```
Decision Table Returns:
  If invoice from Supplier A → Assign to Procurement
  If invoice from Supplier B → Assign to Quality Team
  If invoice from Supplier C → Assign to Finance

Task is automatically created and assigned
based on which condition is true
```

### When to Use
- Different suppliers need different approval
- Complex routing based on multiple factors
- Different team based on document type

### Example
```
Document: Invoice from ABC Corp (Supplier A)
    ↓
Decision Table checks: Which supplier?
    ↓
Result: Supplier A → Procurement Team
    ↓
Create and assign task to Procurement Team
```

---

## Card: ACTION_DECISION_TREE_TASKS_SEQUENTIAL

### Purpose
Creates tasks sequentially based on decision table
Tasks are assigned one at a time with priority order

### When to Use
- Multiple approvals needed in sequence
- Workflow approval chain
- Each person reviews then passes to next

### How It Works
```
Step 1: Create Task for Procurement Manager
        (Priority 1)
    ↓
Step 2: Procurement Manager approves
    ↓
Step 3: Create Task for Finance Manager
        (Priority 2)
    ↓
Step 4: Finance Manager approves
    ↓
Step 5: Export
```

### Priority System
```
Priority 1 → Assign to: Person A
Priority 2 → Assign to: Person B
Priority 3 → Assign to: Person C

They must complete in order (1→2→3)
```

### Example Configuration
```
Decision Table Returns:
  Level 1: Sarah Johnson (Finance)
  Level 2: Mike Smith (Manager)
  Level 3: Director (for approval)

Task Flow:
1. Sarah reviews → Comments
2. Passes to Mike → He reviews
3. Passes to Director → Final approval
4. All complete → Export
```

## Card: ACTION_CREATE_TASK_FOR_USER_SEQUENTIAL

### Purpose

### How It Works

2. Task is created for: Person A

Both in one action
```

### Example

    ↓
ACTION_CREATE_TASK_FOR_USER_SEQUENTIAL:
- Assign Document to: Finance Manager
- Create Task: "Review & Approve High Value Invoice"
- Priority: High
    ↓
Document AND task both go to Finance Manager
```

---

- Create Task: "Evaluate New Supplier Credentials"
- Assign Task to: Same group
- Priority: Medium
    ↓
Group members see document and task

# Task Workflow Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Simple Approval
```
Invoice Arrives (€2000)
    ↓
Condition: Amount between €1000-€5000?
    ↓
YES: Create Task for Finance Manager
    ↓
Finance Manager reviews and approves
```

## Scenario 2: Multi-Level Approval
```
Invoice Arrives (€50,000 - High Value)
    ↓
Create Sequential Tasks:
1. Finance Team (Initial review)
2. Finance Manager (Approval)
3. Director (Final sign-off)
    ↓
Each level completes → Next begins
```

## Scenario 3: Parallel Tasks
```
Invoice Arrives (From New Supplier)
    ↓
Create Task 1: Quality Team (verify supplier)
Create Task 2: Finance Team (check prices)
Create Task 3: Procurement (check contract)
    ↓
All teams work simultaneously
All must complete before proceeding
```

## Scenario 4: Conditional Routing
```
Invoice Arrives
    ↓
Decision Table:
  If amount > €10k → Assign to Director
  If amount €1k-€10k → Assign to Manager

# Task Assignment Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Include specific details in task title
- Set appropriate priority levels
- Set realistic deadlines
- Notify assignees
- Include link to document
- Use clear, actionable descriptions

❌ **Don't:**
- Create vague task titles ("Review this")
- Set everything as High priority
- Forget to notify assigned person
- Create multiple tasks for same work
- Assign to unavailable people

---

# Troubleshooting Tasks

## "Task not assigned to anyone"
**Cause:** User doesn't exist or group is empty

**Solution:**
- Verify user name spelling
- Check user is active in system
- Verify group has members
- Use fallback if needed

## "Person says they didn't get notification"
**Cause:** Email notification disabled or email wrong

**Solution:**
- Check "Send Email" checkbox is enabled
- Verify recipient email address
- Check spam folder
- Resend notification manually

## "Wrong person got task"
**Cause:** Routing logic incorrect

**Solution:**
- Check decision table conditions
- Verify fallback settings
- Test with sample document
- Check for typos in user names

## "Too many tasks created"
**Cause:** Card firing multiple times

**Solution:**
- Check conditions are specific enough
- Verify card only runs once per document
- Review "And" conditions
- Add additional filtering
