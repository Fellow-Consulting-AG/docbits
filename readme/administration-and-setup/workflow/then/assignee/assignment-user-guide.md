# Basic Document Assignment

## Card: DOC_USER_ASSIGN / Assign Document to User

### Purpose
Assigns document to a specific person for their action

### When to Use
- Document needs specific person's review
- Handoff to individual team member
- Accountability tracking
- Assign work to named person

### How It Works
```
Document is "assigned to" = John Smith
Only John can see it as assigned to him
John is responsible for this document
```

### Example
```
Invoice arrives
    ↓
Assign Document to: John Smith (Finance Manager)
    ↓
Only John sees "Assigned to Me"
John must take action on it
```

### Parameters
```
User: [Select which person]
```

- Others can still see document (but not as assigned to them)
- One assignment at a time per document

### When to Use
- Document for team, not individual
- Multiple people can handle

### How It Works

All 10 team members see "Assigned to My Group"
Any team member can take action
```

### Example
```
New vendor invoice
    ↓
Assign Document to: Procurement Team

All procurement team members see it
First available person handles it
```

### Parameters

## Card: ACTION_ASSIGN_DOC_BASED_ON_DECISION_TABLE

### Purpose
Assigns document based on decision table logic

### When to Use
- Different suppliers need different handlers
- Assignment based on amount
- Complex routing logic
- Multiple conditions for assignment

### How It Works
```
Decision Table Logic:
  If Supplier = "ABC Corp" → Assign to: Procurement Team
  If Supplier = "XYZ Inc" → Assign to: Direct Manager
  If Amount > €10000 → Assign to: Finance Director

Document arrives
    ↓
Check: Which condition matches?
    ↓
Assign accordingly
```

### Example: Amount-Based Assignment
```
Invoice: €2000 from ABC Corp

Decision Table checks:
  Is amount > €10000? NO
  Is amount > €5000? NO
  Is amount > €1000? YES

Result: Assign to: Finance Manager
```

### Example: Supplier-Based Assignment
```
Invoice from: Preferred Supplier

Decision Table:
  If preferred supplier → Finance Team
  If new supplier → Procurement Manager
  If blacklisted → Director Review

Result: Assign to: Finance Team
```

### Parameters
```
Decision Table: [Select decision table]
(Decision table contains assignment logic)
```

### How It Works
```
First Decision: Who approves first?

Person 1 approves
    ↓
Second Decision: Who approves next?
    ↓
Assign to: Person 2
    ↓
Person 2 approves (final)
    ↓
Document Complete
```

### Priority System
```
Priority 1: First assignment
Priority 2: Second assignment
Priority 3: Third assignment
(etc.)

Each must complete before next begins
```

# Assignment Decision Trees

## Decision Table Example 1: Amount-Based
```
Amount ≤ €1000
  → Assign to: Finance Team

Amount €1000-€5000

Amount €5000-€20000
  → Assign to: Finance Director

Amount > €20000
  → Assign to: CFO
```

## Decision Table Example 2: Supplier-Based
```
Supplier Type = "Preferred"
  → Assign to: Account Manager

Supplier Type = "New"
  → Assign to: Procurement Manager

Supplier Type = "Problem"
  → Assign to: Procurement Director
```

## Decision Table Example 3: Document Type-Based
```
Document Type = "Invoice"
  → Assign to: Accounts Payable Team

Document Type = "Credit Memo"
  → Assign to: Finance Manager

Document Type = "PO"
  → Assign to: Procurement Team
```

---

# Assignment Workflow Examples

## Example 1: Simple Routing
```
Document Arrives
    ↓
Check: Supplier = "ABC Corp"? YES
    ↓
Assign to: John Smith
(John handles ABC Corp)
    ↓
John reviews and approves
```

## Example 2: Sequential Approval
```
Document Arrives
    ↓
Assign to: Finance Manager (Step 1)
    ↓
Manager reviews
    ↓
Passes to: Finance Director (Step 2)
    ↓
Director reviews
    ↓
Passes to: CFO (Step 3)
    ↓
CFO approves final
```

## Example 3: Amount-Based Routing
```
Invoice: €50,000
    ↓
Decision Table: Amount > €20k?
    ↓
YES → Assign to: CFO
    ↓
CFO approves directly
```

## Example 4: Facility-Based
```
Shipment for: Berlin Office

Assign to: Berlin Warehouse Team
    ↓
Then assign to: Berlin Distribution Team

# Assignment Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Keep decision tables simple
- Test routing logic with samples
- Ensure all paths lead somewhere
- Have fallback for missing users
- Document routing decisions

❌ **Don't:**
- Create circular assignments (A→B→A)
- Assign to non-existent users (without fallback)
- Make routing too complex
- Forget to test routing
- Assign to unavailable people

---

# Troubleshooting Assignment

## "Document not assigned"
**Cause:** Condition not met or user doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Check condition is true
- Verify user exists in system
- Check fallback settings
- Review decision table logic

## "Wrong person assigned"
**Cause:** Decision table or routing logic incorrect

**Solution:**
- Test decision table
- Check conditions
- Verify user mapping
- Review field values

## "Assignment seems to skip someone"
**Cause:** Sequential order incorrect

**Solution:**
- Check priority numbers
- Verify sequence is correct
- Test with sample
- Review decision table ordering
