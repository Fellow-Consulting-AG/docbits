## Purpose:

The **"Assign to Group"** workflow card facilitates the assignment of documents to a specific **group** within the system. This ensures that the document is processed by the appropriate team, streamlining workflow. Enhanced in later versions, it introduces decision tree functionality for dynamic group assignment.

## Components of the Card:

1. **Groups**
   * **Description:** Specifies the **group** to which the document will be assigned.
   * **Detail:** Selected from a dropdown list of available **groups**.



## **Additional Components in Version 3**

1. **Decision Tree (Version 3 Only)**
   * **Description:** Allows the use of a decision tree to dynamically determine the **group** to which the document should be assigned.
   * **Options:**
     * **True:** Enables decision tree processing.
     * **False:** Disables decision tree processing.

## Functionality:

* **Condition Evaluation:** The card only executes its action if both the **"Where"** and **"And Sections"** evaluate as true.
* **Document Assignment:** Assigns the document to the selected **group**. In **Version 3**, the **decision tree** determines the target group dynamically if enabled.

## Setup and Configuration:

* **Select Group:** Choose the **group** from the dropdown list to assign the document.
* **Use Decision Tree (Version 3 Only):** Enable this option if the **decision tree** should be used for dynamic assignment.

## Conclusion:

The **"Assign to Group"** workflow card automates document assignment to predefined **groups**, enhancing team coordination. **Version 3** introduces the ability to dynamically assign groups based on decision tree logic.
