# Send HTTPS Request

## Purpose
This card sends a secure message to a website or service and can receive a response back. It's simpler than the "Call API" card and is useful for quick integrations.

**Real-world example:** Send invoice data to your accounting system, or ask an external system if an employee is approved to process this purchase.

---

## When to Use This Card

Use this card when you need to:
- Send webhook notifications to external services
- Trigger actions in other systems
- Query a simple web service
- Send status updates to other applications
- Perform simple integrations without complex API requirements

---

## How It Works

1. **Trigger Check**: System checks if the "Where" and "And" conditions are met
2. **Build Request**: System prepares the HTTPS request with your parameters
3. **Send Securely**: Data is sent using secure HTTPS connection
4. **Receive Response**: External service responds
5. **Continue**: Workflow proceeds with the response data

- **Method:** POST
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN`
- **Request Data:**
```json
{
  "supplier_id": "SUPP001",

  "amount": 1500.00,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "date": "2025-10-23"
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Webhook Notifications
Send real-time notifications to other systems whenever something happens in DocFlow

**Example:**
- Document approved → Send notification to fulfillment system
- Supplier changed → Notify purchasing team via Slack/Teams webhook

### 2. External System Integration
Connect DocFlow with other business systems for automatic data exchange

**Example:**
- After document is processed → Sync to ERP system
- New supplier added → Create supplier record in master data system

### 3. Approval Workflows
Send document to external approval system and receive decision

**Example:**
- High-value invoice → Send to Finance for approval
- Return document to external system with decision

## Configuration Guide

### Step 1: Get Endpoint Information
Ask the receiving system for:
- [ ] HTTPS URL
- [ ] Required headers
- [ ] Authentication method
- [ ] Expected request format
- [ ] Expected response format

### Step 2: Configure the Card
1. Enter the HTTPS URL
2. Set HTTP method (usually POST)
3. Add authentication if required
4. Format request data as JSON
5. Add any custom headers

### Step 3: Test
Send a test request and verify response

## Response Handling

Your HTTPS request will get a response. Common responses:

### Success (200, 201)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "REC-12345",
  "status": "processed"
}
```

### Bad Request (400)
```json
{
  "error": "Missing required field: invoice_number"
}
```

### Unauthorized (401)
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid authentication token"
}
```

### Server Error (500)
The receiving system has an internal problem

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Certificate Error"
**Cause:** HTTPS security certificate issue

**Solution:**
- Verify the URL is correct
- Check if the website's certificate is valid
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (not HTTP)

### "Connection Refused"
**Cause:** Cannot connect to the server

**Solution:**
- Verify the URL/IP address is correct
- Check if the service is running
- Check firewall rules
- Verify internet connectivity

### "No Response / Timeout"
**Cause:** Server not responding within time limit

**Solution:**
- Check if the service is available
- Verify the endpoint URL
- Check if there are rate limits
- Contact system administrator

### "Invalid JSON"
**Cause:** The request data is malformed

**Solution:**
- Check for missing commas in JSON
- Verify all quotes are correct
- Validate JSON format (use online JSON validator)
- Check for special characters

## Difference from "Call API" Card

| Feature | HTTPS Request | Call API |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Simplicity | Simple | More complex |
| Parameters | Basic | Advanced |
| Error Handling | Basic | Detailed |
| Use for | Quick integrations | Complex APIs |
| Best for | Webhooks | Professional APIs |

## Security Considerations

✅ **Always use HTTPS** (secure connection)

⚠️ **Never:**
- Put passwords in the URL
- Expose API keys in logs
- Include personal data in parameters
- Use HTTP for sensitive data

---

## Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Test with small amounts of data first
- Include error handling
- Log important requests
- Document the integration
- Monitor for failures

❌ **Don't:**
- Call the same endpoint repeatedly if not needed
- Ignore response errors
- Include sensitive data in plain text
- Exceed service rate limits
