## Purpose
This card automatically sends email notifications to groups of users. Instead of assigning work to individual people, you send the message to a group, and all members of that group receive it.

**Real-world example:** When a high-value invoice arrives, automatically send an email notification to everyone in the "Finance Team" group so they're aware it needs review.

---

## When to Use This Card

Use this card when you need to:
- Notify multiple people at once
- Send alerts to team groups
- Broadcast updates to departments
- Notify groups about document status changes
- Send reminders to group members

**Common scenarios:**
- Notify procurement team about new suppliers
- Alert finance team about high-value invoices
- Notify warehouse team about shipments
- Broadcast document status changes

---

## How It Works

1. **Condition Check**: Workflow checks "Where" and "And" conditions
2. **Prepare Email**: System prepares the email using template
3. **Get Group Members**: System finds all members of specified group
4. **Send**: Email is sent to each group member
5. **Log**: Email sending is recorded

- Include link or instructions to access document
- Test template with sample data
- Send to right group (don't over-notify)
- Use templates for consistency

❌ **Don't:**
- Send too many emails (notification fatigue)
- Include sensitive data in emails
- Send to groups that don't need info
- Use unclear subject lines
- Forget to include how to take action
- Send emails to individuals (use group instead)

---

## Performance Notes

- Each email takes ~1 second to send
- Large groups may take time (100 people = ~100 seconds)
- Don't create loops that send thousands of emails
- Monitor email service capacity
- Consider batching if many documents
