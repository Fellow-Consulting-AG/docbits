## **Purpose**

The **"Export Document with Alternate Export"** workflow card enables exporting a document using an alternate export configuration. It offers flexibility by allowing users to bypass the default export configuration and use an alternate one, ensuring compatibility with specific requirements or scenarios.

## **Components of the Card**

**Alternate Export Configuration**

* **Description**: Specifies the export configuration to be used for the document.
* **Detail**: This configuration overrides the default settings and applies the alternate export configuration specified in the workflow.

## **Functionality**

* **Condition Evaluation**:\
  The system evaluates the conditions set in the **"Where"** and **"And Sections"** of the workflow. The card executes only if all conditions are true.
* **Document Export**:\
  Once executed, the card uses the alternate export configuration to process and export the document. This enables tailored export handling for specific workflows.

## **Setup and Configuration**

To configure this card:

1. Ensure the **"Where"** and **"And Sections"** are configured correctly, as the card only executes if these conditions evaluate to true.
2. Verify that the alternate export configuration is valid and active in the system.

## **Conclusion**

The **"Export Document with Alternate Export"** workflow card enhances flexibility and control in document export processes. By allowing the selection of an alternate export configuration, it accommodates diverse export requirements while maintaining efficient workflow automation.
