### **9. Advanced Processing:**

* **Run Workflow:** Triggers another workflow within the system, allowing for complex process chaining.

#### Practical Application

These action cards are used to automate responses based on specific triggers identified in the earlier parts of the workflow setup. For instance:

* If a document is identified as needing review, the "Approve the Document" action can be automatically triggered once it passes all specified conditions.
* For data management tasks, "Set Checkbox" or "Set Field to Text" actions ensure that document fields are updated automatically, reducing manual data entry and the potential for errors.
* Complex tasks like API interactions or status changes streamline interactions not only within the ERP system but also with external services and tools, enhancing integration and functionality.

### Conclusion

The "Then..." section in your workflow system provides robust tools for defining precise actions that should occur as a result of conditions being met in the workflow. By effectively using these actions, businesses can automate routine processes, ensure data accuracy, and respond dynamically to changing information and system states. Understanding how to configure and utilize these actions is key to maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of your ERP system's workflow capabilities.
