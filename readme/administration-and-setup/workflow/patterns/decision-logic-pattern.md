# Decision Logic Pattern

**Pattern Type:** Conditional Routing & Logic
**Complexity:** Medium
**Estimated Setup:** 30-45 minutes
**Common Use Cases:** Multi-path routing, conditional processing, decision trees, business rule implementation

---

## Pattern Overview

This pattern demonstrates how to implement complex decision logic in DocBits workflows using condition cards to route documents through different processing paths based on document attributes, field values, and business rules.

**What This Pattern Does:**
1. Evaluates multiple conditions in sequence or parallel
2. Routes documents to different paths based on conditions
3. Implements business rules and policies
4. Handles complex decision trees
5. Combines multiple criteria for routing decisions

---

## When to Use This Pattern

Use this pattern when you need to:
- ✅ Route documents by amount thresholds
- ✅ Apply different rules for different document types
- ✅ Implement multi-level approval logic
- ✅ Handle complex business policies
- ✅ Create dynamic routing based on multiple criteria
- ✅ Implement exception handling logic
- ✅ Create approval matrices

**Don't use this pattern when:**
- ❌ Simple linear workflow is sufficient
- ❌ All documents follow same path
- ❌ No conditional processing needed

---

## Decision Logic Types

### 1. Simple IF-THEN Logic

```
IF condition:
  → Action A
ELSE:
  → Action B
```

**Example:**
```
IF Amount > €10,000:
  → Assign to Director
ELSE:
  → Assign to Manager
```

### 2. Multiple Criteria (AND Logic)

```
IF condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3:
  → Action A
ELSE:
  → Action B
```

**Example:**
```
IF Amount > €10,000 AND Supplier = "New" AND Department = "IT":
  → Assign to IT Director + CFO (dual approval)
ELSE:
  → Standard approval workflow
```

### 3. Alternative Criteria (OR Logic)

```
IF condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3:
  → Action A
ELSE:
  → Action B
```

**Example:**
```
IF Amount > €50,000 OR Supplier is "Blocked" OR Document has "Urgent" flag:
  → Escalate immediately
ELSE:
  → Standard processing
```

### 4. Nested Decision Tree

```
IF condition1:
  IF condition2:
    → Action A
  ELSE:
    → Action B
ELSE:
  IF condition3:
    → Action C
  ELSE:
    → Action D
```

**Example:**
```
IF Document_Type = "Invoice":
  IF Amount > €10,000:
    → High-value invoice workflow
  ELSE:
    → Standard invoice workflow
ELSE IF Document_Type = "Credit Note":
  IF Amount > €5,000:
    → High-value credit workflow
  ELSE:
    → Standard credit workflow
```

## Complete Workflow Example

### Scenario: Invoice Approval Matrix

**Business Rules:**
1. Amount < €1,000: Auto-approve
2. Amount €1,000-€10,000: Manager approval
3. Amount > €10,000 AND New Supplier: Director + CFO approval
4. Amount > €10,000 AND Existing Supplier: Director approval only
5. Any amount with PO mismatch: Procurement approval first
6. Urgent invoices (flagged): Expedited workflow

**Implementation:**

```
STEP 1: Check for PO Mismatch
  IF PO_Match_Status = "FAIL":
    → Route to Procurement for PO resolution
    → After resolution, continue below

STEP 2: Check Urgent Flag
  IF Urgent_Flag = TRUE:
    → Skip amount checks
    → Direct to highest approver
    → Set priority = HIGH
    → 1-day deadline

STEP 3: Amount-Based Routing (if not urgent)
  IF Amount < €1,000:
    → Auto-approve
    → Export immediately

  ELSE IF Amount < €10,000:
    → Create task for Manager
    → Priority: Medium
    → Deadline: 3 days

  ELSE IF Amount ≥ €10,000:
    CHECK Supplier Status:
      IF Supplier_Age < 180 days (New):
        → Create task for Director (Task 1)
        → After approval, create task for CFO (Task 2)
        → Priority: High
        → Deadline: 2 days each

      ELSE (Existing Supplier):
        → Create task for Director only
        → Priority: High
        → Deadline: 2 days
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Define Condition Cards

**Condition 1: Amount Threshold**
```
Card: CONDITION_DOC_FIELD_AMOUNT
Field: Total_Amount
Operator: IS LESS THAN
Value: 1000
Currency: EUR
```

**Condition 2: Document Type Check**
```
Card: CONDITION_DOC_TYPE_IS_ISNOT
Document Type: IS
Type: Invoice
```

**Condition 3: Supplier Status**
```
Card: CONDITION_SUPPLIER_STATUS_IS_ISNOT
Supplier Status: IS
Status: ACTIVE
```

**Condition 4: New Supplier Check**
```
Card: CONDITION_DOC_FIELD_DATE
Field: Supplier_First_Transaction_Date
Operator: IS AFTER
Value: {{TODAY_MINUS_180_DAYS}}
```

**Guide Reference:** [Condition Cards Complete Guide](../and/condition-cards-complete-guide.md)

---

### Step 2: Build Decision Tree

**Level 1: Document Type**
```
Workflow: "Invoice Processing"

IF Document_Type = "Invoice":
  → Continue to Level 2

ELSE IF Document_Type = "Credit Note":
  → Branch to "Credit Note Processing"

ELSE IF Document_Type = "Receipt":
  → Branch to "Receipt Processing"

ELSE:
  → Route to "Unknown Document Type" handling
```

**Level 2: Amount Thresholds (for Invoices)**
```
IF Amount < €1,000:
  → Branch to "Auto-Approve Path"

ELSE IF Amount < €10,000:
  → Branch to "Manager Approval Path"

ELSE IF Amount < €50,000:
  → Branch to "Director Approval Path"
  → Check Level 3 conditions

ELSE (Amount ≥ €50,000):
  → Branch to "Executive Approval Path"
  → Dual or triple approval required
```

**Level 3: Supplier Analysis (for high-value invoices)**
```
IF Supplier_Status = "BLOCKED":
  → STOP processing
  → Create urgent escalation task
  → Notify procurement and finance

ELSE IF Supplier_Age < 180 days (New):
  → Additional approval required
  → Add CFO to approval chain
  → Enhanced verification

ELSE IF Supplier_Risk_Rating = "HIGH":
  → Additional checks required
  → Fraud detection review
  → Manager pre-approval

ELSE:
  → Standard high-value workflow
```

---

### Step 3: Create Routing Actions

**Path A: Auto-Approve (Amount < €1,000)**
```
Actions:
1. Set field "Approval_Type" = "AUTO"
2. Set field "Approval_Level" = "0"
3. ACTION_APPROVE_DOCUMENT
4. Export to ERP
5. Send confirmation email (optional)
```

**Path B: Manager Approval (€1,000-€10,000)**
```
Actions:
1. Set field "Approval_Type" = "MANUAL"
2. Set field "Approval_Level" = "1"
3. tasks_create:
   - Title: "Approve Invoice {{DOCUMENT_NUMBER}}"
   - Assign to: Department_Manager
   - Priority: Medium
   - Deadline: 3 days
4. Send email notification to manager
5. Wait for task completion
6. If approved: Export to ERP
7. If rejected: Return to supplier
```

**Path C: Director Approval (€10,000-€50,000)**
```
Actions:
1. Set field "Approval_Type" = "MANUAL"
2. Set field "Approval_Level" = "2"
3. Check Supplier_Age:
   IF New (< 180 days):
     - Create Task 1: Director approval
     - After Task 1: Create Task 2: CFO approval
     - Dual approval required
   ELSE:
     - Create Task: Director approval only
4. Priority: High
5. Deadline: 2 days
6. Send email notifications
7. Wait for completion
8. If all approved: Export
9. If any rejected: Return to supplier
```

**Path D: Executive Approval (≥ €50,000)**
```
Actions:
1. Set field "Approval_Type" = "EXECUTIVE"
2. Set field "Approval_Level" = "3"
3. Sequential approvals:
   - Task 1: Finance Director
   - Task 2: CFO
   - Task 3: CEO (if > €100,000)
4. Priority: Urgent
5. Deadline: 1 day each
6. Send urgent notifications
7. Executive dashboard update
8. Wait for all approvals
9. If all approved: Export
10. If any rejected: Executive review meeting
```

## Advanced Decision Logic Patterns

### Pattern 1: Score-Based Routing

**Calculate a risk score and route accordingly:**

```
Risk Score Calculation:
  Score = 0

  IF Amount > €50,000: Score += 30
  IF Supplier_Age < 180 days: Score += 25
  IF PO_Variance > 10%: Score += 20
  IF Supplier_Country = "High Risk Country": Score += 15
  IF Payment_Terms < 30 days: Score += 10

  Total Score Range: 0-100

Routing:
  IF Score < 20: Auto-approve
  IF Score 20-50: Manager approval
  IF Score 51-75: Director approval
  IF Score > 75: Executive approval + fraud check
```

**Implementation:**
```
1. ACTION_CALCULATE_FIELD: Calculate risk score
2. ACTION_SET_FIELD_TO_NUMBER: Store score
3. CONDITION_DOC_FIELD_NUMBER: Check score thresholds
4. Route based on score
```

---

### Pattern 2: Department-Based Matrix

**Different approval rules by department:**

```
Department Matrix:

  IT Department:
    Amount < €5,000: IT Manager
    Amount ≥ €5,000: IT Director + CIO

  Finance Department:
    Amount < €10,000: Finance Manager
    Amount ≥ €10,000: CFO

  Operations Department:
    Amount < €3,000: Operations Manager
    Amount ≥ €3,000: COO

  General:
    Amount < €2,000: Department Manager
    Amount ≥ €2,000: Department Director
```

**Implementation:**
```
1. Check Department field
2. Based on department, check amount threshold
3. Route to appropriate approver
4. Different thresholds per department
```

---

### Pattern 3: Time-Based Logic

**Different rules based on timing:**

```
Month-End Processing (Last 3 days of month):
  IF Today in last 3 days of month:
    - Priority: URGENT
    - Deadline: 1 day
    - Approver: On-duty finance manager
    - Expedited workflow
  ELSE:
    - Standard priority
    - Standard deadline
    - Standard workflow

Business Hours vs After Hours:
  IF Time between 9 AM - 5 PM:
    - Assign to current shift
  ELSE:
    - Queue for next business day
    - OR route to on-call approver

Fiscal Period:
  IF Document_Date in Current_Fiscal_Period:
    - Standard processing
  ELSE:
    - Flag as "Prior Period"
    - Require accounting approval
    - Additional checks
```

---

### Pattern 4: Exception-Based Routing

**Route exceptions separately:**

```
Exception Detection:

  No Exception:
    → Standard workflow

  Minor Exception (Auto-fixable):
    → Auto-correct
    → Log correction
    → Continue standard workflow

  Medium Exception (Needs review):
    → Create review task
    → Flag document
    → After fix: Continue workflow

  Major Exception (Requires escalation):
    → Stop processing
    → Create urgent task
    → Notify multiple levels
    → Manual intervention required

Exception Types:
  - Missing required field
  - Invalid field value
  - PO mismatch
  - Duplicate invoice
  - Supplier mismatch
  - Amount discrepancy
```

## Configuration Best Practices

### 1. Keep Logic Clear and Maintainable

✅ **Good:**
```
IF Amount > 10000:
  → High value path
ELSE:
  → Standard path
```

❌ **Bad (Too Complex):**
```
IF (Amount > 10000 AND (Supplier = "A" OR Supplier = "B") AND NOT (Status = "X" OR Status = "Y") AND Department IN [1,2,3]):
  → Complex path
```

**Better: Break into steps:**
```
Step 1: IF Amount > 10000: Continue, ELSE: Standard path
Step 2: IF Supplier in allowed list: Continue, ELSE: Review
Step 3: IF Status valid: Continue, ELSE: Reject
Step 4: IF Department authorized: Approve, ELSE: Escalate
```

---

### 2. Document Decision Logic

**Always include:**
- Purpose of each decision point
- Business rule being implemented
- Expected outcomes
- Exception handling

**Example Documentation:**
```
Decision Point: Amount Threshold Check
Business Rule: BR-INV-001 (Invoice Approval Matrix)
Purpose: Route invoices based on amount thresholds per company policy
Thresholds:
  < €1,000: Auto-approve (CFO approved threshold)
  €1,000-€10,000: Manager approval (Delegation matrix)
  > €10,000: Director approval (Signature authority)
Exceptions: Urgent invoices skip to highest level
Updated: 2025-10-23
Owner: Finance Department
```

---

### 3. Test All Paths

**Testing Matrix:**

| Test Case | Amount | Type | Supplier | Expected Path | Status |
|-----------|--------|------|----------|---------------|--------|
| TC1 | €500 | Invoice | Existing | Auto-approve | ✅ |
| TC2 | €5,000 | Invoice | Existing | Manager | ✅ |
| TC3 | €15,000 | Invoice | New | Director+CFO | ✅ |
| TC4 | €60,000 | Invoice | Existing | Executive | ✅ |
| TC5 | €2,000 | Credit Note | Existing | Credit workflow | ✅ |
| TC6 | €100,000 | Invoice | Blocked | Stop & Escalate | ✅ |

---

### 4. Monitor Decision Metrics

**Track:**
- Distribution across decision paths
- Auto-approval rate
- Manual review rate
- Average processing time per path
- Exception rates
- Path utilization

**Example Metrics:**
```
Month: October 2025
Total Invoices: 1,250

Decision Path Distribution:
- Auto-approved (< €1k): 680 (54%)
- Manager path (€1k-€10k): 420 (34%)
- Director path (€10k-€50k): 120 (10%)
- Executive path (> €50k): 30 (2%)

Processing Time:
- Auto-approve: < 1 minute
- Manager path: 2.5 days average
- Director path: 1.8 days average
- Executive path: 3.2 days average

Exceptions: 15 (1.2%)
```
