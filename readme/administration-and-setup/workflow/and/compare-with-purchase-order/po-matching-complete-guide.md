## Understanding PO Matching

When you receive an invoice, it should match the Purchase Order (PO) placed earlier. PO matching cards automatically check if invoice data matches PO data.

**The Big Picture:**
```
PO Placed     Invoice Arrives     PO Matching     Decision
(‚Ç¨100)    ‚Üí   (‚Ç¨103)          ‚Üí   (Check if       ‚Üí Approve/Reject
Qty: 100      Qty: 100            within tolerance)
```

# 1. Purchase Order Full Match

## Purpose
Checks if the entire invoice matches the PO perfectly or within tolerance

## When to Use
- Before approving an invoice
- As a preliminary quality check
- To identify problems early

## How It Works
System compares:
- Invoice quantities vs PO quantities
- Invoice prices vs PO prices
- Invoice items vs PO items
- Invoice total vs PO total

## Result
- **TRUE** (Full Match): Everything matches, proceed
- **FALSE** (Mismatch): Something doesn't match, needs review

## Example
```
PO:
- Item ABC: Qty 100, Unit Price ‚Ç¨50 = ‚Ç¨5000
- Item XYZ: Qty 50, Unit Price ‚Ç¨20 = ‚Ç¨1000
- Total: ‚Ç¨6000

Invoice:
- Item ABC: Qty 100, Unit Price ‚Ç¨50 = ‚Ç¨5000
- Item XYZ: Qty 50, Unit Price ‚Ç¨20 = ‚Ç¨1000
- Total: ‚Ç¨6000

Result: ‚úÖ FULL MATCH
```

# 2. Unit Price Comparison (Document vs PO)

## Purpose
Compares the unit price on the invoice with the unit price on the PO

## Parameters
- **Unit Price Tolerance**: Allow variance up to this amount
- **Tolerance Type**: Percentage (%) or Absolute (‚Ç¨/$)
- **Operator**: Is Equal to, Is Greater than, Is Less than, etc.

## How It Works (Percentage Tolerance)

**Formula:**
```
Variance % = |(Invoice Price - PO Price)| / PO Price √ó 100

Check: Is Variance % ‚â§ Tolerance %?
```

**Step-by-Step Example:**
```
Step 1: Get prices
  PO Unit Price: ‚Ç¨100.00
  Invoice Unit Price: ‚Ç¨103.00

Step 2: Calculate difference
  Difference = |‚Ç¨103.00 - ‚Ç¨100.00| = ‚Ç¨3.00

Step 3: Calculate percentage
  Percentage = (‚Ç¨3.00 / ‚Ç¨100.00) √ó 100 = 3%

Step 4: Check tolerance (5% allowed)
  Is 3% ‚â§ 5%? YES ‚úÖ

Result: PASS - Within tolerance
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Small Increase (Accepted)
```
PO Price: ‚Ç¨50.00
Invoice Price: ‚Ç¨51.50
Tolerance: ¬±3%

Calculation:
  Variance = |(‚Ç¨51.50 - ‚Ç¨50.00)| / ‚Ç¨50.00 √ó 100
  Variance = ‚Ç¨1.50 / ‚Ç¨50.00 √ó 100 = 3%

Is 3% ‚â§ 3%? YES ‚úÖ ACCEPT
```

### Example 2: Large Increase (Rejected)
```
PO Price: ‚Ç¨50.00
Invoice Price: ‚Ç¨55.00
Tolerance: ¬±3%

Calculation:
  Variance = |(‚Ç¨55.00 - ‚Ç¨50.00)| / ‚Ç¨50.00 √ó 100
  Variance = ‚Ç¨5.00 / ‚Ç¨50.00 √ó 100 = 10%

Is 10% ‚â§ 3%? NO ‚ùå REJECT - NEEDS REVIEW
```

### Example 3: Discount (Also Checked)
```
PO Price: ‚Ç¨100.00
Invoice Price: ‚Ç¨97.00
Tolerance: ¬±5%

Calculation:
  Variance = |(‚Ç¨97.00 - ‚Ç¨100.00)| / ‚Ç¨100.00 √ó 100
  Variance = ‚Ç¨3.00 / ‚Ç¨100.00 √ó 100 = 3%

Is 3% ‚â§ 5%? YES ‚úÖ ACCEPT (Discount is within tolerance)
```

### Example 4: Absolute Value Tolerance
```
PO Price: ‚Ç¨10.00
Invoice Price: ‚Ç¨10.50
Tolerance: ¬±‚Ç¨1.00 (absolute, not %)

Calculation:
  Variance = |‚Ç¨10.50 - ‚Ç¨10.00| = ‚Ç¨0.50

Is ‚Ç¨0.50 ‚â§ ‚Ç¨1.00? YES ‚úÖ ACCEPT
```

## What to Do With Results

**If PASS ‚úÖ:**
- Continue to next check
- Or approve invoice
- Or proceed with export

**If FAIL ‚ùå:**
- Flag for manual review
- Ask supplier for explanation
- Contact procurement team
- Approve with note if acceptable

# 3. Quantity Comparison

## Purpose
Checks if the quantity ordered matches the quantity invoiced

## Parameters
- **Tolerance**: Amount or % allowed to differ
- **Operator**: Equals, Greater than, Less than
- **Quantity Type**: Ordered, Received, Open

## Calculation Example

**Percentage Tolerance:**
```
Formula:
  Quantity Variance % = |(Invoice Qty - PO Qty)| / PO Qty √ó 100

Example:
  PO Quantity: 100 units
  Invoice Quantity: 103 units
  Tolerance: ¬±5%

  Variance = |(103 - 100)| / 100 √ó 100
  Variance = 3 / 100 √ó 100 = 3%

  Is 3% ‚â§ 5%? YES ‚úÖ ACCEPT
```

**Absolute Tolerance:**
```
Formula:
  Quantity Variance = |Invoice Qty - PO Qty|

Example:
  PO Quantity: 100 units
  Invoice Quantity: 102 units
  Tolerance: ¬±5 units

  Variance = |102 - 100| = 2 units

  Is 2 units ‚â§ 5 units? YES ‚úÖ ACCEPT
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Over-Delivery (More than Ordered)
```
Ordered: 100 units
Invoiced: 110 units
Tolerance: ¬±5%

Variance = |(110-100)|/100 √ó 100 = 10%

Is 10% ‚â§ 5%? NO ‚ùå

Decision: Contact supplier - more delivered than ordered
Possible reason: Error by supplier, partial shipment already received
```

### Under-Delivery (Less than Ordered)
```
Ordered: 100 units
Invoiced: 95 units
Tolerance: ¬±5%

Variance = |(95-100)|/100 √ó 100 = 5%

Is 5% ‚â§ 5%? YES ‚úÖ

Decision: Accept - within tolerance
Possible reason: Partial shipment, rest to follow
```

# 4. Combined Price of Quantity Difference

## Purpose
When quantity differs, calculates if the total price difference is acceptable

## Why This Matters
```
Scenario: You ordered 100 units but received 110
- Quantity is 10% over (bad)
- BUT: You're only charged for 10% extra
- Combined effect might be acceptable
```

## Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Combined Variance = Quantity Variance √ó Price Variance

If both are within tolerance, combined is usually acceptable
```

**Example:**
```
PO:
- Unit Price: ‚Ç¨100
- Quantity: 100
- Total: ‚Ç¨10,000

Invoice:
- Unit Price: ‚Ç¨102 (2% higher)
- Quantity: 105 (5% higher)
- Total: ‚Ç¨10,710

Analysis:
- Price variance: 2% ‚úÖ
- Quantity variance: 5% ‚úÖ
- Combined effect: 1.02 √ó 1.05 = 1.071 = 7.1% total increase

Is combined variance acceptable? Usually YES ‚úÖ
```

# 5. Item ID / Supplier Item Number Comparison

## Purpose
Checks if the items in the invoice match the items in the PO

## How It Works

**Exact Match (Simplest):**
```
PO Item ID: ABC-123
Invoice Item ID: ABC-123
Result: ‚úÖ MATCH
```

**Supplier Item Number (More Common):**
```
PO Item: ABC-123 (Our internal code)
Supplier Item: SUPP-456 (Their code for same item)
System matches these as same item
Result: ‚úÖ MATCH
```

## Scenario: What If It Doesn't Match?

```
PO Item: ABC-123 (Copper Wire, 2mm)
Invoice Item: ABC-124 (Steel Wire, 2mm)

Result: ‚ùå NO MATCH

Actions:
1. Is this a substitution? Check with procurement
2. Is this an error? Contact supplier
3. Is the description similar? Verify manually
```

---

# 6. Order Type Verification

## Purpose
Verifies the purchase order type is correct

## Order Types
- **Standard Order**: Regular purchase
- **Rush Order**: Urgent, may have premium
- **Frame Agreement**: Long-term contract
- **Blanket Order**: Open-ended contract
- **Consignment**: You don't pay until used

## Check Example
```
PO Order Type: Standard Order
Invoice Order Type: Standard Order
Result: ‚úÖ MATCH

If mismatch: Could affect terms, payment, pricing
```

---

# 7. Delivery Date Verification

## Purpose
Checks if delivery date matches the promised date on the PO

## Calculation

**Late Delivery:**
```
Formula:
  Days Late = Invoice Delivery Date - PO Promised Date

Example:
  PO Promised: 2025-10-15
  Actual Delivery: 2025-10-22
  Days Late = 7 days

If tolerance is ¬±3 days:
  Is 7 ‚â§ 3? NO ‚ùå LATE
```

**Early Delivery:**
```
Formula:
  Days Early = PO Promised Date - Invoice Delivery Date

Example:
  PO Promised: 2025-10-15
  Actual Delivery: 2025-10-10
  Days Early = 5 days

Early delivery is usually OK ‚úÖ
Unless you need it at specific time
```

## Tolerance Settings
```
¬±3 days: Allow 3 days late or early
¬±5 days: Allow up to 5 days variance
0 days: Must match exactly
```

---

# 8. Charge Verification (Taxes, Shipping, Etc.)

## Purpose
Checks if additional charges (taxes, shipping, handling) match PO

## Common Charges
```
- Shipping: ‚Ç¨50
- Handling: ‚Ç¨10
- Packaging: ‚Ç¨5
- Insurance: ‚Ç¨15
- Taxes: ‚Ç¨300
```

## Calculation

**Example: Shipping Charge Check**
```
PO Shipping: ‚Ç¨50.00
Invoice Shipping: ‚Ç¨51.00
Tolerance: ¬±3%

Variance = |‚Ç¨51.00 - ‚Ç¨50.00| / ‚Ç¨50.00 √ó 100 = 2%

Is 2% ‚â§ 3%? YES ‚úÖ ACCEPT
```

**Example: Multiple Charges**
```
PO Total Charges:
  - Shipping: ‚Ç¨50
  - Taxes: ‚Ç¨300
  - Handling: ‚Ç¨10
  Total: ‚Ç¨360

Invoice Total Charges:
  - Shipping: ‚Ç¨50
  - Taxes: ‚Ç¨312 (11% tax)
  - Handling: ‚Ç¨10
  Total: ‚Ç¨372

Difference: ‚Ç¨12
Check if within tolerance ‚úÖ or ‚ùå
```

---

# 9. Tax Verification

## Purpose
Verifies tax amounts are calculated correctly

## Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Tax Amount = Subtotal √ó Tax Rate

Example:
  Subtotal: ‚Ç¨1000
  Tax Rate: 19%
  Expected Tax: ‚Ç¨1000 √ó 0.19 = ‚Ç¨190

Invoice Tax: ‚Ç¨190
Match? YES ‚úÖ
```

**Common Issues:**
```
1. Tax rate changed (region-based)
2. Tax applied to wrong amount (before/after discounts)
3. Multiple tax rates (some items 7%, others 19%)
4. Tax exempt items (0% tax)
```

**Example: Multi-Rate Taxation**
```
Item A: ‚Ç¨100 @ 19% tax = ‚Ç¨119
Item B: ‚Ç¨100 @ 7% tax = ‚Ç¨107
Item C: ‚Ç¨100 @ 0% tax = ‚Ç¨100
Total: ‚Ç¨326

Invoice shows ‚Ç¨325 (‚Ç¨1 error)

Check: Within tolerance or needs attention?
```

# 10. Facility/Cost Center Matching

## Purpose
Ensures the invoice is for the correct facility/cost center

## Example
```
PO is for:
- Facility: Berlin Plant
- Cost Center: CC-2025

Invoice should have:
- Facility: Berlin Plant ‚úÖ
- Cost Center: CC-2025 ‚úÖ

If different facility: May need different approval
```

---

# 11. Supplier Status Validation

## Purpose
Checks if the supplier is still approved/active

## Status Types
```
‚úÖ ACTIVE: Approved, can do business
‚ö†Ô∏è ON HOLD: Temporarily blocked
‚ùå INACTIVE: No longer doing business
‚ö†Ô∏è CONDITIONAL: Only for specific items
```

## Check Example
```
Supplier: ABC Corp
Status in Database: ACTIVE
Status when creating PO: ACTIVE
Status when invoice arrives: INACTIVE

Alert: Supplier status changed! Investigate why.
```
