# Best Practices for Conditions

✅ **Do:**
- Use specific conditions
- Test logic with samples
- Order conditions logically
- Have fallback for all paths
- Document complex logic

❌ **Don't:**
- Create circular conditions (A if B, B if A)
- Make conditions too complex
- Forget about edge cases
- Assume field always has value
- Create impossible conditions

---

# Combining Multiple Conditions

```
Condition 1: Type = Invoice?
    AND
Condition 2: Amount > €5000?
    AND
Condition 3: Supplier status = Active?
    ↓
ALL TRUE → Process
SOME FALSE → Stop
```
