## **Purpose:**

This DocBits card checks if a specified date/time value falls within a defined range. It enables workflows to proceed or halt based on whether the condition is met, making it suitable for time-sensitive operations or scheduling workflows.

## **Functionality:**

* **Date/Time Validation:** This card evaluates whether a given date/time is within a specified range using the following conditions:
  * **Is:** Checks if the date/time is within the defined start and end range (inclusive).
  * **Is Not:** Ensures the date/time falls outside the defined range.

**Date/Time Range:** Users specify the start and end date/time values to define the range for comparison.

## **Usage:**

This card is ideal for scheduling, compliance checks, or validating time-based conditions in workflows. For example, it can be used to ensure tasks are executed only during predefined timeframes or verify deadlines.

## **Example Scenario:**

* A user configures the card to check if the **submission date** of an invoice **is between** **"2024-11-01"** and **"2024-11-30"**. If the submission date falls within this range, the workflow proceeds to payment processing. If not, the workflow triggers a notification for further review.

By using the "Date/Time Range Validation" card, organizations can ensure accurate scheduling, enhance compliance, and streamline workflows by adhering to predefined time constraints.
