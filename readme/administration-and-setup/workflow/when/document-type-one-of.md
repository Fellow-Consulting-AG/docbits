  * **Is Not:** Ensures that the document does not match any of the selected document types.
* **Document Types:** Users can select from multiple supported document types, including:
  * **Invoice:** Financial records submitted for payment.
  * **Debit Note:** Documents indicating an adjustment that increases the amount owed.
  * **Credit Note:** Documents indicating a reduction in the amount owed.

  * **Order Confirmation:** Documents that confirm an order has been accepted.
  * **Advance Shipment Notice:** Documents notifying of an upcoming shipment.

## **Usage:**

This card is ideal for document managers and administrators who need to ensure that documents are categorized into one of several types. It is especially useful for document workflows where a document may be classified under multiple categories, improving automation and classification accuracy.

## **Example Scenario:**

* A user uploads a document that could be either an "Invoice" or "Debit Note." Using the "Is" operator, the card confirms that the document matches one of the selected types, allowing the system to apply the appropriate rules and categorization.

By using the "Multiple Document Type Validation" card, organizations can enhance workflow flexibility, automate categorization, and ensure that documents are properly handled even when multiple types are applicable.
