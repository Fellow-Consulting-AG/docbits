  * **Approve**: Routing the document for necessary approvals within the sub-organization.

* **Configuration**: Users set up the card by specifying the operator and the sub-organization. They might also define specific rules or triggers for when the card should activate.
* **Monitoring**: Users can monitor the card's activity via a dashboard that shows ongoing and completed operations, providing transparency into document handling processes.
