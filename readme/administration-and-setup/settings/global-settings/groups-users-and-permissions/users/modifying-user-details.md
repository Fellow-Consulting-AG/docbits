* **Review the impact of role changes:** If you changed the user's user role, review the impact of that change on security access levels. Make sure that after the role change, the user has the permissions required to continue performing their duties.
* **Send notification (optional):** You can send a notification to the user to inform them of the changes made.

After completing these steps, the user details are successfully updated and the user has the new information and permissions according to the changes made.

* **Optional Notification:** You can optionally send a notification to the user to inform them of the removal of their access.
* **Review Tasks and Documents:** Before removing the user, review what tasks or documents are assigned to the user. Move or transfer responsibility for those tasks or documents to another user to make sure nothing gets lost or left unfinished.
* **Save Changes:** Confirm the user’s removal and save the changes.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the user’s access is safely removed while properly managing all relevant tasks and documents.
