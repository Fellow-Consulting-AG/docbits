# Users

User Settings is an area in a system where users can adjust personal preferences, account settings, and security settings. Typically, user settings include options such as password changes, profile information, notification preferences, and possibly individual permissions to access certain features or data.

In most organizations, only authorized people have access to user settings, usually administrators or system administrators. This is because the settings may contain sensitive information that could compromise the security of the system if changed by unauthorized persons. Administrators are able to manage user settings to ensure that they comply with organizational policies and requirements and that the integrity of the system is maintained.
