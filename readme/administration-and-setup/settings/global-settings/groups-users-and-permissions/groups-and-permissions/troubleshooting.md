# Troubleshooting

### If you are having problems with permissions and are unable to access certain documents or perform actions you believe you should be able to, the following troubleshooting tips may help:

#### **Check permission settings:**&#x20;

* Check the permission settings for the documents or resources in question to ensure that users have the necessary permissions.&#x20;
* Make sure that users have access either directly or through group membership.

#### Check group membership:&#x20;

* Check that the affected users are actually members of the groups that have been granted access.&#x20;
* Make sure that users have not been accidentally removed from relevant groups.

#### Check individual permissions:&#x20;

* Check that individual permissions have been set at the user level that could override group permissions.&#x20;
* Make sure that these individual permissions are configured correctly.

#### Check inheritance settings:&#x20;

* Make sure that permissions are inherited correctly and are not blocked by parent folders or other settings.

#### Check permission history:&#x20;

* Check permission history or logs to see if there have been any recent changes to permissions that could be causing the current issues.

#### Test with a different user account:&#x20;

* Try accessing the affected documents with a different user account to see if the issue is user-specific or affects all users.

#### Check error messages:&#x20;

* Make sure users are getting accurate error messages indicating permission issues. This can help you pinpoint and diagnose the problem more accurately.

#### Update permissions:&#x20;

* If all other solutions fail, try reconfiguring permissions for the affected users or groups and ensure that all required permissions are granted correctly.



By following these troubleshooting tips, you can identify and resolve permission-related issues to ensure that users have the required access rights and can work effectively.
