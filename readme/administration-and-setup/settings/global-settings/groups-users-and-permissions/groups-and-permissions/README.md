## Components of the Groups and Permissions Section

1. **Activate/Deactivate Groups and Permissions**: A toggle that allows the system administrator to enable or disable the use of groups and permissions across the platform. When turned off, the system may default to a less granular access control model.
2. **Group List**: Shows the list of available user groups within the organization. Each group can be configured with specific permissions. Administrators can add new groups by clicking the "+ New" button.
3. **Permissions Table**:
   * Displayed once a group is selected or a new group is being configured.
   * Lists all document types recognized by the system (e.g., INVOICE, CREDIT\_NOTE, DELIVERY\_NOTE).
   * For each document type, there are checkboxes for different permissions:
     * **View**: Permission to see the document.
     * **Update**: Permission to modify the document.
     * **Delete**: Permission to remove the document from the system.
     * **First Approval**: Permission to perform the initial approval of the document.
     * **Second Approval**: Permission to perform a secondary level of approval (if applicable).
