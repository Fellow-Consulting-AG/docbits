# Defining App Color in Company Settings

## Overview

The **App Color** setting allows administrators to define the color scheme of the application interface. This feature is particularly useful for distinguishing between different environments such as testing, sandbox, and production. By assigning distinct colors to each environment, users can easily identify which environment they are working in, reducing the risk of performing critical actions in the wrong environment.

## Accessing the App Color Setting

1. **Navigate to Company Settings**:
   * From the main menu, click on the **Company Information** section.
2. **Locate the App Color Section**:
   * Scroll down to the **App Color** section within the Company Information settings.

## Setting the App Color

1. **Choose a Color**:
   * Click on the color box or enter a hex code directly into the text field.
   * A color picker will appear, allowing you to select the desired color.
   * You can enter a specific hex code if you have a predetermined color for the environment.
2. **Save the Color**:
   * Once you have selected the color, click on the **Save** button to apply the change.
   * The application interface will immediately update to reflect the new color.
3. **Reset to Default**:
   * If you wish to revert to the default color, click the **Reset** button.

## Best Practices for Environment Colors

To avoid confusion, it is recommended to establish a standard color scheme for each environment:

* **Production**: Use a neutral or default color, such as **#FFFFFF** (white) or **#f0f0f0** (light grey), to indicate the live environment.
* **Testing**: Use a bright or alerting color, such as **#ffcc00** (yellow) or **#ffa500** (orange), to indicate a testing environment.
* **Sandbox**: Use a distinct color, such as **#007bff** (blue) or **#6c757d** (grey), to indicate a sandbox or development environment.

## Subscription Plan Notice

Under the App Color section, administrators will also see information related to the **Subscription Plan**. This includes the current plan, its status, and the remaining days of subscription.
