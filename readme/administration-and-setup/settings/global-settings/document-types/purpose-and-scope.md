# Purpose and Scope

## The purpose and scope of correctly setting up document types in DocBits is critical to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of document processing.&#x20;

### Here are some key points that explain the importance of this process:

### Purpose of correctly setting up document types Improved document organization

By accurately classifying documents into specific types, they can be easily categorized and managed. This makes it easier to find and retrieve documents when they are needed.

**Automated workflows:**

Many document management systems, including DocBits, use document types to drive automated workflows. For example, invoices can be automatically routed for approval while contract documents are sent for signature. Correct document type mapping allows these processes to be carried out efficiently and without errors.

**Rights management and security:**

Different document types can be subject to different access controls and security levels. By correctly typecasting documents, it can be ensured that only authorized people have access to sensitive information.

**Compliance and legal requirements:**

Many industries are subject to strict legal and regulatory requirements regarding the handling of documents. Setting up document types correctly helps ensure that all necessary compliance requirements are met by handling and storing documents according to their category.

### Scope of setting up document types correctly

**Defining specific document types:**

Every type of document managed in the system should have a clearly defined document type. This includes, for example, invoices, contracts, reports, emails and technical drawings.

**Attribution and metadata:**

Each document type should have specific attributes and metadata that facilitate its classification and processing. For example, invoices could contain attributes such as invoice number, date and amount, while contracts have attributes such as contract parties, term and conditions.

**Automation rules and workflows:**

Specific rules and workflows should be defined for each document type. This can include automatic notifications, approval processes or archiving policies.

**Training and user guidance:**

Users should be trained to use the document types correctly and understand the importance of correct classification. This helps to minimize errors and maximize efficiency.

**Regular review and adjustment:**

The document types and associated processes should be regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary to ensure they continue to meet current business needs and processes.



Setting up document types correctly is a key aspect of effectively using a document management system like DocBits. Not only does it make documents better organized and easier to find, it also enables automated processes, increases security, and ensures regulatory compliance. To fully realize the benefits, document types must be carefully defined, the corresponding processes implemented, and users trained regularly.
