#### Overview

The Document Types section lists all document types recognized and processed by Docbits. Administrators can manage various aspects such as layout, field definitions, extraction rules, and more for each type of document. This customization is key to ensuring accurate data handling and compliance with organizational standards.

#### Key Features and Options

1. **Document Type List**:
   * Each row represents a document type such as Invoice, Credit Note, Delivery Note, etc.
   * Document types can be standard or custom, as indicated by labels like "Standard."
2. **Edit layout**: This option allows administrators to modify the document layout settings, which include defining how the document appears and where data fields are located.

5. **Fields**: Manage the data fields associated with the document type, including adding new fields or modifying existing ones.
6. **Model Training**: Configure and train the model used for recognizing and extracting data from the documents. This may involve setting parameters for machine learning models that improve over time with more data.
