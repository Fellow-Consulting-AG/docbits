# Purpose and Use: Model Training

Regular model training is critical to ensure that a document processing system continues to work effectively and accurately as document formats and content change.&#x20;

**Here are some key reasons for regular model training:**&#x20;



**Adaptation to new formats:**&#x20;

* Documents are often created in different formats, be it PDF, Word, Excel, or others.&#x20;
* New versions of these formats may have additional features or changes in formatting that the processing system may not recognize unless it is updated accordingly.
* By regularly training the model, the system can adapt to these new formats to ensure smooth processing.

**Adaptation to changing content:**&#x20;

* The content of documents can change over time, be it due to updates to business processes, changes in policies, or new industry standards.&#x20;
* Regular training allows the processing system to adapt to these changes and continue to deliver accurate results.

**Optimizing accuracy:**

* By training the model with new data, algorithms and models can be continuously improved to increase the accuracy of document processing.
* This is especially important in areas where precision and reliability are critical, such as processing financial documents or medical records.&#x20;

**Handling exceptions:**&#x20;

* Regular model training allows the system to better identify and handle exceptions and boundary conditions.&#x20;
* This can help reduce errors and improve overall system performance.&#x20;

**Ensuring compliance:**  &#x20;

* In industries with strict compliance requirements, it is important that the document processing system is always up to date to meet legal requirements.
* Regular training and updating of the model can help ensure the system complies with current standards.

Overall, regular model training is an essential component to the effectiveness and reliability of a document processing system. It allows the system to continuously adapt to changing requirements and deliver accurate results, which in turn improves efficiency and productivity.
