**Review and test:**

* Before making changes to a script, carefully review the existing code and consider what impact your changes might have.
* Test the script in a test environment to make sure it works as expected.

**Documentation:**

* Don't forget to document your changes.
* Write down what changes you made and why so that other users on the team can understand how the script works and what impact your changes might have.

**Publishing changes:**

* When you are satisfied with your changes, republish the script to the DocBits production environment for the updated version to take effect.

These steps allow you to enable, disable and manage existing scripts in DocBits to adapt them to current processing needs and ensure that your documentation processes run efficiently and correctly.
