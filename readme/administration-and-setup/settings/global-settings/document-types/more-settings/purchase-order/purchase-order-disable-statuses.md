# Purchase order disable statuses

## **Overview**

The **PO Disable Statuses** setting allows users to specify purchase order (PO) statuses that prevent invoices from being matched to those POs. If a purchase order has a status listed in this setting, it **cannot** be used for invoice matching in the PO matching screen, stopping further processing of related invoices until the PO's status changes to one that is not disabled.\
\
By using this setting, users can ensure that purchase orders with specific statuses do not undergo further invoice processing, reducing errors and preventing unnecessary payments.

## **Activation Steps**&#x20;

### **How to Identify a Disabled Purchase Order**

In the **PO Matching** screen, a disabled purchase order appears **crossed out**. This visually indicates that the PO is currently restricted from being matched due to its status.
