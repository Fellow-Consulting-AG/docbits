## **How It Works**

* **When disabled**, the system only exports purchase order lines that are matched with an order confirmation line. Unmatched purchase order lines will not be included in the export.
* **When enabled**, the system exports all purchase order lines, even if they are not matched to an order confirmation line.

For example, if a purchase order has **three lines**, but the supplier sends an **order confirmation with only one line**, you match that line to a purchase order line. The remaining two unmatched purchase order lines will be:

* **Excluded from the export** if the setting is disabled.
* **Included in the export** if the setting is enabled.
