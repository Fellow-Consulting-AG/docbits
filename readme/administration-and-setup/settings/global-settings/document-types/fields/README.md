## Overview

The Fields setting provides a user interface where administrators can manage the properties and behavior of individual data fields associated with a document type. Each field can be adjusted to optimize the accuracy and efficiency of data capture and validation.

## Key Features and Options

1. **Fields Configuration**:
   * **Field Names**: Lists the names of the fields, typically corresponding to the data elements within the document, like "Invoice Number" or "Purchase Order Date".
   * **Required**: Administrators can mark fields as required, making sure that data must be entered or captured for these fields to complete the document processing.
   * **Read Only**: Fields can be set to read-only to prevent modification after data capture or during certain stages of document processing.
   * **Hidden**: Fields can be hidden from view in the user interface, useful for sensitive information or for simplifying user workflows.
2. **Advanced Settings**:
   * **Force Validation**: Ensures that data entered into a field passes certain validation rules before being accepted.
   * **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: This toggle can be switched on to enable OCR processing for a specific field, useful for automated data extraction from scanned or digital documents.
   * **Match Score**: Administrators can define a match score, a threshold used to determine the confidence level of data recognition or matching, impacting how data validation and quality checks are performed.
3. **Action Buttons**:
   * **Create New Field**: Allows adding new fields to the document type.
   * **Edit Icons**: Each field has an edit icon that allows administrators to further configure field-specific settings, such as data type, default values, or connected business logic.
   * **Save Settings**: Commits the changes made to the field configuration
