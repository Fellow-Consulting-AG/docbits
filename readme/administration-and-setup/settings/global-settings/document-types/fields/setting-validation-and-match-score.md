**Impact:**

* Enforcing validation rules helps detect errors early and improves data quality. Users are prompted to enter correct data, which increases the integrity of the database.

### Match Score:

This setting allows you to match the entered value against a predefined reference value.

**To set this up:**

* Navigate to the field's settings.
* Enable the Match Value option.
* Enter the reference value to compare the entered value against.

**Impact:**

* Setting a match value allows you to ensure that the entered data matches a known standard or predefined norm. This is especially useful when you want to ensure that the data is consistent and meets certain criteria.
* Using these settings can improve data integrity and recognition accuracy in your document processing system.

You ensure that only correct and valid data is captured, increasing the quality of your database and improving the reliability of your analytics and reports.
