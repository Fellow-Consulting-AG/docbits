# Supplier Setting

1. **Supplier Permissions**: This setting defines what actions a supplier can or cannot take within the system. For instance, you can control whether suppliers can view only their transactions, submit invoices, access payment histories, or update their information. Setting these permissions helps maintain system security and ensures suppliers only access the data necessary for their interactions with your business.
2. **Supplier Group**: Suppliers can be categorized into different groups based on criteria such as the type of products they provide, their geographic location, or their role within the supply chain. Grouping suppliers allows for more streamlined management and can facilitate the application of specific workflows or rules to a collection of suppliers rather than individually.
3. **User and Supplier Group Mapping**: This setting involves linking users within your organization to one or more supplier groups. This is crucial for managing which employees have access to information and interaction capabilities with specific supplier groups. For example, a procurement manager in your company may need access to all supplier groups, while a project manager may only need access to suppliers related to their projects.
4. **Policy and Privacy Statement**: It's essential to have clear policies and privacy statements accessible to suppliers regarding how their data will be used and protected. This setting allows you to manage and communicate these documents to suppliers, ensuring compliance with legal standards and building trust with your suppliers by transparently showing how their information is handled.
