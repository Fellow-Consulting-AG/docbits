In the "Export Settings" section of the Document Processing settings, you manage how documents are exported after processing. This includes configuring various export methods tailored to specific needs, such as direct file transfers or integration with enterprise systems like Infor. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the options and functionality within this setting:

1. **Export Method Selection**: You can choose how documents should be exported. Common methods include SFTP, webhooks, and direct integration with systems like Infor IDM (Infor Document Management), Infor ION (Intelligent Open Network), and other Infor-related options. Each method supports different types of workflows and integration requirements.
2. **Configuration Details**:
   * For SFTP, you typically need to specify the server URL, username, password, and the target folder where the documents will be uploaded.
   * For Infor integrations, you might need to configure specific mappings or provide API keys to ensure that the documents are correctly processed and sent to the Infor ecosystem, aligning with the existing data structure and flows.
3. **Customization**: Depending on the document type (e.g., invoices, order confirmations) and the sub-organization, different export settings can be configured to meet varying business rules or compliance requirements.
4. **Integration Flexibility**: The interface allows for multiple integration setups to be active simultaneously, enabling users to handle various document types and destinations efficiently. This modular setup ensures that different parts of the business can use tailored workflows without affecting each other.
5. **Adding and Editing Configurations**: Users can add new configurations or edit existing ones by specifying details like document type, the method of export, and credentials or settings specific to the chosen export method.
