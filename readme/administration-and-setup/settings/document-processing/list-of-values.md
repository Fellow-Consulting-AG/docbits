The "List of Values" setting in your document processing system is essentially a central repository for managing predefined values that can be used across various forms and fields within the system. This setting is particularly useful for standardizing data entry and ensuring consistency across documents processed by the system.

1. **Segmentation by Type**: Each section, such as "ISO\_Currency", "Invoice\_Sub\_Type", "Invoice\_Type", and "Test", represents a different category of predefined values. These categories are used to manage different types of data inputs relevant to their specific contexts within the system.
2. **Values and Synonyms**: Under each category, you can define multiple values. For example, under "Invoice\_Sub\_Type", values like "Cost Invoice" and "Purchase Invoice" are listed. Additionally, you have the capability to assign synonyms to these values, enhancing the flexibility and reach of data capture. For example, "Cost Invoice" has synonyms like "Kostenrechnung" and "Cost Invoice".
3. **Usage Across Sub-Organizations**: These values can also be made specific to certain sub-organizations within your setup, allowing for customization and localization of document processing workflows.
4.  **Adding and Managing Values**: When you press the action button, you are presented with two options for adding values to your list. The first option is to add rows manually. By clicking the **Add Row** button, a popup appears that lets you introduce new values along with any synonyms. If you need to add multiple entries, you can simply click **Add More Values** to generate another row.\


    The second option is to upload a CSV file. To do this, click the **Upload CSV** button, select a **CSV** file you wish to import, choose the correct delimiter to ensure the data is parsed accurately, and then click **Upload** to complete the process.

    In addition, each row includes an action button that allows you to edit or delete an existing entry as needed.&#x20;
