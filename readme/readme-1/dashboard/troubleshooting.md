# Troubleshooting

## Here are specific troubleshooting tips for common issues related to dashboard settings:



**Filters not applied correctly:**

* First, check the filter settings to make sure the correct filters have been applied and that they are displaying the desired data.
* Make sure that filters are applied logically and consistently. Sometimes incorrect filter logic or incorrect combinations can produce unexpected results.
* Provide users with guidance on how to use filters correctly to ensure they can use the filtering features effectively.

**Delays in loading data:**

* Check the network connection to make sure it is stable and not causing delays.
* Check the server load and the performance of the data source to see if that is the problem. You may need to optimize the data source or switch to a more powerful infrastructure.
* Implement caching mechanisms to reduce loading times, especially for frequently accessed data. Encourage users to optimize their data queries by retrieving only the required data fields and using filters to reduce the amount of data.

**Browser issues:**

* Make sure the browser they are using is compatible with the dashboard and has all required updates installed.
* Recommend users to clear their browser cache regularly to avoid memory issues and ensure they are getting the most up-to-date data.
* Check for extensions or plugins in the browser that might be interfering with the dashboard and temporarily disable them if necessary to isolate problems.

**User-specific issues:**

* Offer individualized support for users who continue to have problems. You may need to check their specific settings, permissions, or network configuration to identify and resolve the issue.



By providing users with these specific troubleshooting tips, you can help them effectively resolve common issues related to dashboard settings and increase their productivity.
