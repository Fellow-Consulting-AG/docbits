## Detailed Description of the Validation Screen's Purpose and Use

### Purpose of the Validation Screen

* **Ensuring Data Quality**: The validation screen checks the accuracy and completeness of extracted data to prevent the entry of incorrect or incomplete information.
* **Data Integrity**: It ensures that the data complies with specified requirements and standards.
* **Error Prevention**: By facilitating early detection and correction of errors, the validation screen helps mitigate potential issues during subsequent data processing.
* **User Friendliness**: The system provides immediate feedback to users when errors or inconsistencies are detected, allowing for prompt corrections.
* **Compliance**: The validation screen helps ensure adherence to legal and organizational regulations and standards.
* **Efficiency**: It reduces the effort required for future corrections and minimizes the need for manual checks.

### Using the Validation Screen

* **Automatic Data Extraction**:
  * **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Automatically reads text from scanned documents or images.
  * **Structured and Unstructured Data**: Processes data from various document types, including forms, invoices, and contracts.
* **Checking and Validating Data**:
  * **Format Validation**: Ensures that data is in the correct formats (e.g., date formats, phone numbers, email addresses).
  * **Required Fields**: Confirms that all mandatory fields are completed.
  * **Range Checking**: Validates numeric data to ensure it falls within specified limits.
  * **Consistency Checking**: Verifies that related data fields contain consistent information (e.g., ensuring start and end dates align).
* **User Interaction and Troubleshooting**:
  * **Error Messages**: Displays clear and actionable error messages when data does not meet validation requirements.
  * **Manual Review and Correction**: Allows users to manually review and amend data when automatic validations fail.
* **Data Cleaning and Standardization**:
  * **Automatic Correction**: Suggests or performs automatic corrections when errors are detected.
  * **Data Formatting**: Standardizes data formats to ensure consistency across datasets.
* **Security and Access Rights**:
  * **Input Filters**: Protects against malicious inputs through robust validation and filtering mechanisms.
  * **Access Control**: Ensures that only authorized users can access and modify sensitive data.
* **Data Consistency**:
  * **Cross Validation**: Checks for consistency among related data fields (e.g., validating that start and end dates align).
  * **Duplicate Entries**: Prevents duplicate entries within the database.
* **User Guidance**:
  * **Error Messages**: Provides specific and understandable error messages when entries do not comply with requirements.
  * **Help and Hints**: Offers help texts or tooltips to assist users in entering data correctly.

In summary, the validation screen in DocBits is instrumental in ensuring the quality of extracted data, facilitating early error detection and correction, and enhancing the overall efficiency of data processing workflows.
