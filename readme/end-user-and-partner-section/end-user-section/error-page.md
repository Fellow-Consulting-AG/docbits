# Error

## Overview

If an error occurs during your document workflow, the document will enter the **Error** status. When this happens, you can click on the document to:

* View critical details explaining why the error occurred
* Add notes to the document
* Print or download the document

This allows you to diagnose issues and take appropriate actions without losing access to the document itself.

This page provides an overview of the tools available to help you review and manage documents in the **Error** state.

## Error Details

On the right side of the document view, you will find the **Error Message**, which provides a brief description of what went wrong.\
Below the error message, the **Exception** is displayed, showing where the error occurred in the code. This information is useful for troubleshooting and should be included when reporting the issue to support.
